00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.030
Lisa Galea: Hello.

2
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.790
Helena: Hello?

3
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.480
Helena: How are you going?

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.140
Lisa Galea: surviving.

5
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.670
Lisa Galea: You know, I got that right, that I was here

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.270
Lisa Galea: An hour, because I came an hour ago, and then I was like, that's the wrong time, you Wally.

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.470
Lisa Galea: But then I guess…

8
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.799
Helena: Of course, because they were having started on Sunday, didn't they?

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:38.480
Lisa Galea: My calendar said it was 3 o'clock, and I'm like, I don't understand how this time change works. I didn't even know that on Sunday. Because your phone just goes, doesn't it? You just wake up and it's a different time, who knows what time it's? I don't give a shit, I don't even wear a watch.

10
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.119
Lisa Galea: I don't know what time I was using, someone says time change, and I'm like, oh my god, I love that, when I'm late, I'm still early.

11
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.349
Helena: You're an hour ahead of yourself.

12
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.359
Lisa Galea: That's why it's so good for me.

13
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:59.599
Lisa Galea: Thank you, I love that. I'm so glad we're ahead, like, we're ahead of America, because I'll, like, turn up to a meeting, I'll be like, thank God it's tomorrow. I might be ready by then properly.

14
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.400
Helena: A place that might actually be ready.

15
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.579
Lisa Galea: I'm ready, but I'm not really, so I'll be ready tomorrow.

16
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.900
Lisa Galea: Excellent, girls, let's get started. I am excited for what we're gonna do.

17
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.370
Lisa Galea: And I thought today, we'll make a plan. One, we should make sure that we do have regular meetings.

18
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:35.289
Lisa Galea: already planned in advance, I thought, because when I woke up this morning, I was like, oh shit, what are we meeting today? And I was like, we probably do want to book that in, so if you girls let me know, I am also flexible if you said, oh, customer's just come in and I have to change it, Lisa.

19
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.740
Lisa Galea: But I thought we should, like, sort of lock it in over the next… Little baby.

20
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.789
Lisa Galea: 4 or 6 weeks, because then we're like, we know this is going to happen, because it.

21
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.490
Helena: Yeah.

22
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.040
Lisa Galea: Really, to do it in 6 weeks is gonna be a push.

23
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.410
Lisa Galea: Alright, so that's what I thought. Let's make sure we are recording. Did it say when I came in? Yes, good.

24
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.390
Helena: I think so.

25
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.880
Lisa Galea: Silentai.

26
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:04.259
Lisa Galea: So, where are you girls at with your… let me make sure I even made a… I even changed desktops here when you saw the neat stuff.

27
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.530
Lisa Galea: Oh, so that's good. I've got, stuff set up.

28
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.079
Lisa Galea: I actually was just looking, because I had the extra time, because what I would normally like to do is a, digital footprint of where we're at now.

29
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.540
Helena: Okay. But then I was like, oh, AI must be able to do that way better than me, so I'm just.

30
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.149
Lisa Galea: I've just actually loaded the Python, which is open source, to do the proper one from the back end.

31
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:40.780
Lisa Galea: That I'll do. But I've also started a list, because they're… they wanted to pay all this money, it was like 2 to 5 grand, like, the proper programs that, you know, manage your brand.

32
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.910
Lisa Galea: And I was like, I just want a free brand audit of where I'm at. I want to be able to find out where we're at and where we've got words.

33
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.849
Helena: And we actually did quite a good little thing of what we should set up, like, in Google tagging and things like that for you.

34
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.649
Lisa Galea: So, I will tag you in and organize that.

35
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.089
Lisa Galea: That's no good, your… that's why it was weird. Your Zoomie isn't on the right dashboard.

36
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.480
Lisa Galea: Spadacious way.

37
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.890
Lisa Galea: Let's see… how cool was… I was pretty happy.

38
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.740
Lisa Galea: Because, you know your dad's… can you see me?

39
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.230
Helena: Yep.

40
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.990
Lisa Galea: So, you know I shared the project management portal with you?

41
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.280
Lisa Galea: Did you see that?

42
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.090
Helena: Oh, I don'.

43
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.690
Lisa Galea: Oh, no, I think I told you… God, girls are gonna think I'm fab.

44
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:37.050
Lisa Galea: Wait till you see what I've built! I was like, oh my god. So I went in here from our… started with, say, these three transcribes.

45
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.940
Lisa Galea: So what this is, you will not be getting to this point, so do not panic, but it's actually pretty easy.

46
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:56.640
Lisa Galea: And that's what I wanted you to see, is, like, I'm basically doing… asking questions, and as I ask questions, I make the documents. So instead of giving it a knowledge base.

47
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.610
Lisa Galea: It's like I'm engineering my knowledge base.

48
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.329
Lisa Galea: So, when we,

49
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.619
Lisa Galea: When we're looking at prompts, and we're thinking it loses information because it's not going to exact sources.

50
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:18.440
Lisa Galea: Which is why, like, knowledge bases work so much better. But this is, like, an evolving one, so if we have another meeting and we changed our project management.

51
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.139
Lisa Galea: we could then, it would just update the Gantt chart for us, and we can also make sure we're on top of things.

52
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.800
Helena: Okay.

53
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.309
Lisa Galea: You can see I'm seeing it through this end. It's not very useful for you.

54
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.709
Lisa Galea: But, I have then set it up so your dad could see at the other end.

55
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.459
Lisa Galea: really, it was just to manage it, because I'm still really managing it

56
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.249
Lisa Galea: It's hard to know where's the easiest for you guys.

57
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:54.280
Helena: Okay, like, what's the easiest? But for me, being able to ask questions and us to put things in there, and it to move the Gantt chart and make sure we are totally on.

58
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.180
Lisa Galea: target

59
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.110
Lisa Galea: That's what that's for, it's not really for you, but I just wanted you to see how I built it.

60
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.519
Helena: Lisa, is that our Google Drive that we can put stuff in?

61
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.080
Lisa Galea: Yeah, it's… I have got a folder for you.

62
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.130
Helena: Okay.

63
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:26.359
Lisa Galea: with this, Disrupt Falcon Swiss. So what I did was, in order for you to see this, I have… because it's… the good thing as well with, like, this is, as I'm making those knowledge documents, they're all on my computer, there's none going out into the web.

64
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.170
Lisa Galea: Which, obviously, with security, that's what we're… it's like, I think Notion's great, but…

65
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.010
Lisa Galea: I don't know if we're meant… I don't think we're meant to be putting all our stuff in there.

66
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:46.559
Lisa Galea: We're meant to put summaries of the meeting in there, like I checked. It's like, from this meeting, we make a summary, that goes in there so we can project manage and make sure it's happening with tasks.

67
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.740
Lisa Galea: But we're not meant to put all your details of everything we've talked about in a meeting in there, because it hasn't got that final end

68
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.869
Lisa Galea: security that, like, Google has and offers does.

69
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.379
Lisa Galea: And Odoo, I looked into Odu on the weekend, because, to be honest, I thought that was a specialty

70
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.450
Lisa Galea: program.

71
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.620
Lisa Galea: for medical.

72
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:17.109
Lisa Galea: like, to do your thingies, do you know what I mean? And I looked into it, but I hadn't really looked into it, like, what does this do? I just thought, oh, that was a cool program that was to do with your business.

73
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.199
Lisa Galea: And it's… obviously, I realize, no, it's not. It's a proper, like, Salesforce-y type thing.

74
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.740
Helena: Yeah.

75
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.810
Lisa Galea: But it gives you very good protection, et cetera, et cetera. It puts those guardrails in for you, which is…

76
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.490
Helena: Oh, good.

77
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:36.270
Lisa Galea: So, it's excellent. It's based on ChatGBT, because when I showed this to your dad, he was like, oh, I've just started putting stuff up in…

78
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.550
Lisa Galea: Odie.

79
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:46.179
Lisa Galea: And really goes, it's not as detailed, and I was like, well, it's mostly because he wouldn't have the right prompts, because it's basically, it can do whatever I can do.

80
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.200
Helena: Right.

81
00:06:47.200 --> 00:07:02.480
Lisa Galea: So the questions I've put into mine, and that looks all confusing, I've got prompts that it's just like 1, 2, 3, 4, you could put in chat GPT, and it'd be exactly the same. It's just, I'm just building out all the documents. And then this is how you would see it as a customer.

82
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:03.600
Helena: Okay.

83
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:10.020
Lisa Galea: So you could go, here's the timeline, here's all the documents, so you had access to them, whatever, or what I've made.

84
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.750
Lisa Galea: And then also… but that's, like, just for you to download and look, and then also it's going through Project Risk, as you know.

85
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.690
Lisa Galea: So it's good because we can stay on task, but what I love the most is if I normally do a brand… a Gantt chart.

86
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.020
Lisa Galea: I have time at the beginning to plan it. It's like, I'm on board. And then we're in the sprint, and then you're like.

87
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.860
Lisa Galea: Thanks.

88
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:40.849
Lisa Galea: This way is like, this is what's happened, we've gone on another branch, can we make sure everything aligns for it?

89
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.000
Helena: Yeah.

90
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.450
Lisa Galea: So, that's what I think it's great for, but I also thought you should see how powerful… I mean, that's pretty amazing.

91
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.590
Lisa Galea: And partly, I will say, I'm just typing in, how'd you do this?

92
00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:02.830
Lisa Galea: don't know what I'm doing, so don't stress! It, like, as you work with it, it is still, like, as I'm working here…

93
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.529
Lisa Galea: Like, I said, oh, I went and I went…

94
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:19.759
Lisa Galea: I wanted to show you this process as well, because part of us finding out the information with branding and stuff, we are… I think you've got a lot of good stuff already done, but I really want you to know how to think and how to use LLMs moving forward.

95
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.140
Lisa Galea: So I was like, okay, I want to find a digital footprint.

96
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:43.460
Lisa Galea: So the first thing I did was I went to Perplexity. I didn't go to my normal one where it's got all my stuff about me. I just went to Perplexity to go have a look. I haven't got a paid account, but I was like, what's the best way? I want to show you the prompt, because that's the other thing I'm seeing that people are really doing wrong.

97
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.140
Lisa Galea: is you've got to think… I will transcribe this all for you. You have to think…

98
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.850
Lisa Galea: AI is basically creating averages.

99
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.300
Lisa Galea: of information.

100
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.930
Lisa Galea: And the neural networks it's built on are for a 4-7 year old.

101
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.589
Lisa Galea: So, if you were giving a task to a 4-7 year old.

102
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.939
Lisa Galea: You wouldn't give it 20 at once.

103
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:12.839
Lisa Galea: You wouldn't… you would explain the context, you would say, these are the tools, and you're only allowed to touch these ones?

104
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:20.619
Lisa Galea: Because… you know, they don't… they even start… it's crazy what they start doing.

105
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.819
Isabelle: Okay, go home. Okay.

106
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:30.599
Lisa Galea: You know, the more you narrow that as well with, like, when you're doing averages, the more you narrow where you're looking, you're going to get better data, because the web's got too much shit on it.

107
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:37.629
Isabelle: So we really want to make sure we're doing clean prompts, and the key to doing that is using the right language.

108
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.699
Lisa Galea: Let me just find a plexi.

109
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.440
Lisa Galea: Do you guys know that, that when you have a billion tabs open, you can just type that in there?

110
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.220
Lisa Galea: See? The arrow?

111
00:09:50.710 --> 00:10:02.960
Isabelle: Do you think, Lisa, that, I'm not getting the right output yet from Make? Not because of the prompts, but because I'm asking it to do too many things at once?

112
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:12.710
Lisa Galea: you will find it's much better to do 10 mini steps, where you are also… that's what I've… I also created on…

113
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:18.659
Lisa Galea: Like, what… how are we thinking about creating… like, what do we want to create? That's the most important outcome?

114
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.140
Isabelle: It's slow.

115
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.070
Lisa Galea: And then…

116
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:20.900
Isabelle: Do you want some…

117
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:26.009
Lisa Galea: That's what I would say, because, well, when you're testing, and you're watching it, and you're running

118
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.380
Lisa Galea: You've done it in miniature bits, which you'll get better results, because it doesn't have to…

119
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:33.980
Isabelle: Read.

120
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.430
Lisa Galea: Imagine, even me, would you?

121
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.210
Isabelle: On humans.

122
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.419
Lisa Galea: Imagine if you gave a human, oh, do this project, blah blah blah, nope.

123
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.810
Isabelle: Okay.

124
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:49.970
Lisa Galea: Everyone's freaking out about it. Exactly. Yeah, like, they're saying context engineering, this is the new word, which is what I just showed you.

125
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:50.609
Isabelle: Excuse me.

126
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.670
Lisa Galea: It's like, well, if you weren't putting in context in the first place, that's why you were.

127
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.190
Isabelle: finishing answers.

128
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.469
Lisa Galea: It makes no sense.

129
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:04.660
Lisa Galea: And it wouldn't be able to do that job. So keep that in mind. Have I told you why I'm doing this, what I want to.

130
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.540
Isabelle: that you probably had for in the.

131
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.110
Lisa Galea: Really key is use the right language.

132
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.760
Isabelle: Kathy.

133
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.499
Lisa Galea: So when I.

134
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.840
Isabelle: Actually, it's a…

135
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.409
Lisa Galea: When I started, I'm launching a newsletter, so I started doing that yesterday.

136
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.780
Isabelle: I'm.

137
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:27.179
Lisa Galea: The first thing I typed in was, who would you contact to create an award-winning subscription newsletter that created global social change?

138
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:34.370
Lisa Galea: Because it was like, I want the AI to act as somebody, because I'm building a, like, editor.

139
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.790
Lisa Galea: Like, who's the best editor in the world, and are they really called an editor?

140
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.670
Lisa Galea: And they're not. There was 4 different jobs that I'd never heard of in my life.

141
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.970
Isabelle: On the left.

142
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:52.890
Lisa Galea: For now, my bot is gonna be so precise, because when you say you do behavioral science, like, I explained me.

143
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.319
Lisa Galea: And it's like, well, I'm only going to get data from people who are talking in this language.

144
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.450
Isabelle: Which means that? And you get…

145
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.640
Lisa Galea: A much better result.

146
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.649
Lisa Galea: So you have to keep it as really in your… where's my proposal?

147
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.240
Isabelle: to share with you.

148
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.120
Lisa Galea: showing you.

149
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.800
Isabelle: the gospel.

150
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.649
Lisa Galea: complexity, when I started.

151
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.570
Isabelle: There's the problem, at least not.

152
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.120
Lisa Galea: Problem is, I want it in the bloody.

153
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.070
Isabelle: I can answer.

154
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.879
Lisa Galea: I got 2 Google Drives open.

155
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.669
Lisa Galea: though, I was like.

156
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.990
Isabelle: Like, I'.

157
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.320
Lisa Galea: running.

158
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.380
Isabelle: That's extremely strong.

159
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.530
Lisa Galea: Yes, my loop.

160
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.380
Isabelle: Once applied, and then logic.

161
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.610
Lisa Galea: Do you want to turn your microphone off, whoever, because I can hear you.

162
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.430
Isabelle: Oh, yeah, sorry, that's okay.

163
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.870
Lisa Galea: I'll freak my brain out.

164
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.630
Lisa Galea: Because I can't cope with that noise.

165
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:51.360
Lisa Galea: Alright, here we go. So, I went in, I'm performing. Now, first of all, as I went to write, I was like, I'm doing, and then I'm like, I'm not doing it, because that's not how we speak in my industry.

166
00:12:51.840 --> 00:13:01.990
Lisa Galea: we're performing a brand new. So as soon as I say performing, it's only going to go and look at people who are performing a brandy audit, not an idiot on Pinterest.

167
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:13.450
Lisa Galea: Okay, so it's like, I'm starting to tell it the language so it's narrowing the field. And I want to map their current digital footprint, what's the most effective way to use AI to gather this data.

168
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:25.370
Lisa Galea: And then I'm like, what LLM models are people sharing in forums like Reddit that give best results for scraping data off the web? So it knows what I want to do, why I want to do it.

169
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.689
Lisa Galea: And I've given it a clue that I actually want information from what people are saying.

170
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.750
Lisa Galea: I don't want… Like an ad.

171
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.529
Lisa Galea: So then it's come back and told me that, and…

172
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:51.609
Lisa Galea: I'm like, what are best practice for optimal results? The word best practice is working very well at the moment, because I'm saying, what's the best practice for this?

173
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.840
Lisa Galea: And it goes and finds it instead of just telling me step-by-step instructions that are bollocks.

174
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:04.020
Lisa Galea: It might tell me them, and I'm like, could you please go and check that they are the best practice for an inclusive team?

175
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.490
Lisa Galea: And it comes back, and it makes it so much better.

176
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:14.460
Lisa Galea: So, think of words like that, because those are used in a professional place.

177
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:24.849
Lisa Galea: And having those words will also get you better results. If you don't know what they are, because I often don't, and I think that's why I'm better, I'm, like, I go and ask Google.

178
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:34.689
Lisa Galea: Who's the person? What are the steps? I don't do it in the feed I'm working in. I come and just do it in shit like this, so it's not messing up my history.

179
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:41.749
Lisa Galea: Okay, so I just keep it out in another one where I'm just like, this is researched stuff. But see how it told me all these expensive ones?

180
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.359
Lisa Galea: And I was like, I don't want to do that.

181
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.669
Lisa Galea: What free ones are available?

182
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.530
Lisa Galea: Because they were, like, 5 grand. I was like, we're not looking to go on a plan.

183
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:55.840
Lisa Galea: And then, it gave me my manual searches, and it also gave me recommendations.

184
00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:01.710
Lisa Galea: So I'm like, oh, cool, that's put me in a good place. So now I can do a comparison on these ones.

185
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.490
Lisa Galea: And see where we go. So see how, as soon as, like, he gave me, I was like.

186
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.510
Lisa Galea: How much do these things cost, you've told me to do?

187
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.020
Lisa Galea: So I'm like, run a comparison on…

188
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.560
Lisa Galea: Brand audit platforms, create a comparison table, prices, pros and cons for these programs.

189
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.399
Lisa Galea: So I've really told… I haven't just said, run a comparison table.

190
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.229
Lisa Galea: I've told it what I want it to include, okay? So, that was cool, because I was like, that's not what I want.

191
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:35.729
Lisa Galea: So as soon as it recommends me stuff in another program, I just whip over here, go, which one's the best? Can you go and look on Reddit?

192
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:42.710
Lisa Galea: So we actually know we're getting… at least we're getting better information to make a better decision. We're not just…

193
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:50.310
Lisa Galea: tossing the LLM, okay? So that's, I think, will get you better results, and, we're gonna have some funds.

194
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.589
Lisa Galea: scraping people off the web, because I love doing that.

195
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:59.579
Lisa Galea: Alright, so anything we do, we'll update in here, but it's really just to show you the power of this.

196
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:06.929
Lisa Galea: And what you can find out. And then also, it's pretty handy, we can just share information immediately.

197
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.760
Lisa Galea: And you could just do this, you don't have to do it in GitHub, you can just do it from your one you created.

198
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.639
Lisa Galea: Like, I can be in Gemini. It's Gemini in here.

199
00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:25.019
Lisa Galea: There's one where it just lets you have a free website HTML page.

200
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.500
Lisa Galea: And so, you just go into Gemini, I was doing research.

201
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.950
Lisa Galea: So I wanted to research,

202
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:42.599
Lisa Galea: men… I think people are getting a little, like, I think biases of, like, you know how we're scared of plane flights?

203
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:53.530
Lisa Galea: And I keep hearing people talking like men are going to be, like, perpetrating them all the time, and we can't leave our kids with them, and stuff like this. I'm like, I don't know any man I can't leave my kids with.

204
00:16:54.770 --> 00:17:00.299
Lisa Galea: Like, I think most men are good humans. I think they even beat them up in prison if they've touched kids.

205
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.950
Lisa Galea: You know, like, I think our biases, so I wanted to find out when did that happen.

206
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:10.969
Lisa Galea: what was the trigger? Because we used to be able to play in the street, we used to trust our neighbours.

207
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:17.600
Lisa Galea: So, I went through that, and obviously it did me a… I did a research report on finding out what I was…

208
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.680
Lisa Galea: Thinking?

209
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:27.699
Lisa Galea: I then did a… so it gave me this big report, and I wanted to share that with my friend, and I'm like, they don't want to read that shit, Lisa.

210
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:37.829
Lisa Galea: So then, I just go here. So one, this is now almost a HTML page. If it made it for me, I can just copy it and paste it in this other program.

211
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.339
Lisa Galea: Let's see here, I just asked it… oh, make it a web page.

212
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.200
Lisa Galea: It will be done for you.

213
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:52.489
Lisa Galea: And I said, make infographic, okay? So I'll just do that now, like, while we're working. But you could just go to this, open.

214
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.759
Lisa Galea: Wait, that's gonna mess me up.

215
00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:01.810
Lisa Galea: And it… it all shows it as a full infographic. I don't think it's gonna let me do it while we're on it.

216
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.360
Lisa Galea: We can, new tap.

217
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.680
Lisa Galea: Which is also fab, because you can start having lots going on.

218
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.519
Lisa Galea: Pretty much wherever we…

219
00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:21.250
Lisa Galea: So, see that?

220
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:34.609
Lisa Galea: So, really quickly, I could show them, this is what caused… and we went to the state from this… a boy got abducted in America in 1983, and obviously that's sad, and he was disappeared.

221
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:43.420
Lisa Galea: But, like, you can't believe the percentage of people who watch this, and then the father went on to do, like, a TV series and everything on it.

222
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.079
Lisa Galea: And from there, it started building the…

223
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.050
Lisa Galea: Our mind, where we start getting afraid of things.

224
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.359
Lisa Galea: I mean, and I just don't think it's very useful for society.

225
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.790
Lisa Galea: If we are not thinking that we're safe with our own humans.

226
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.099
Lisa Galea: And our partners in life, really.

227
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:08.869
Lisa Galea: So, but can you see how quick and easy you could send that to a stakeholder explaining something of yours?

228
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.190
Helena: Yeah.

229
00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:10.860
Lisa Galea: And it'.

230
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.410
Helena: That'd be good.

231
00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:17.770
Lisa Galea: Once you… you can use it so quickly, and all you have to then go is code, it's a HTML document, that's it.

232
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.719
Lisa Galea: And then you would just go to the free one, where it just lets you have a free one page.

233
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.350
Lisa Galea: Paste it in, and that page is live for them to see.

234
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:36.590
Lisa Galea: So, it is pretty handy, like, the speed of being able to share that data with my friend. Like, I'm sure if you went and… I know men love all those charts.

235
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:44.480
Lisa Galea: So, once you know what you want, you can write this, and then go, oh, here's some information I got for you.

236
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.230
Lisa Galea: They think you're a champion.

237
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.219
Lisa Galea: So, it's a really good way of communicating it, especially visually, I think.

238
00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.879
Lisa Galea: And it's done a pretty good job.

239
00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:00.199
Lisa Galea: That's why also this branding is really key, because

240
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:07.280
Lisa Galea: If you've got a document that's a knowledge base on your brand, it will go and always use the same fonts, it will always use the same stuff to make these.

241
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.569
Helena: Oh, good.

242
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:15.149
Lisa Galea: You see? I already… that's why I'm like, okay, it's doing everything I want, you better make sure you actually know what you want.

243
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:22.179
Lisa Galea: So, that's why I think having that clarity, it's like, I don't… I'm doing this for the bots, that's why I keep telling my team.

244
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.179
Lisa Galea: for the bots, I don't want to be organized.

245
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:34.639
Lisa Galea: Alright, so there is a lot of things in the way we work that we'll be just learning how to use AI to find the answers to what we need.

246
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:44.279
Lisa Galea: Have you guys… I'm assuming that you already have a brand vision and stuff like that, with your dad being a nice, organized human. What is it?

247
00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.199
Helena: As in our brand guidelines.

248
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.410
Lisa Galea: But it is not a very useful one, isn't…

249
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:58.010
Lisa Galea: Do you have any idea what any of your purpose is, or any of anything else? Because, like, everyone in your company should know what it is.

250
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:06.660
Helena: Yes and no. We have very, loosey-goosey… we, how do I say this nicely? I'm in an office with a lot of ears.

251
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.799
Helena: There are pillars.

252
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.459
Helena: And each pillar, as a strategy.

253
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.639
Helena: And… Brand guidelines that is followed.

254
00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.999
Helena: But there is no…

255
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.950
Lisa Galea: Umbrella.

256
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.230
Helena: umbrella.

257
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.859
Lisa Galea: So when you're saying… So, are they, like, different departments?

258
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.320
Helena: Yes.

259
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:32.270
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

260
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:49.690
Lisa Galea: How does it look at the moment? Because that's the problem, is like, do we… are we having to make artwork, or can we pull it together that we can do… No, we should have enough artwork, as in fonts, colors, logo, all of that. I don't think we really… I think it's gathering it.

261
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:55.419
Helena: Yeah, and it's more utilizing it in a way that's speaking to the people that we want to speak to.

262
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.969
Lisa Galea: And maybe giving them templates.

263
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:04.760
Helena: Oh, yes, yes. And, plans, like, 6 monthly plans for things.

264
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:11.320
Lisa Galea: Yeah, and setting them up for success is what we want, so then they're more confident to move forward, and everyone's more useful.

265
00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:16.339
Lisa Galea: Right, so I have got a thing. Have you got any of that information?

266
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.620
Lisa Galea: Can you gather that information that we.

267
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:24.589
Helena: Yeah, I've got our… our marketing girl, Odette, is ready to put that in.

268
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.180
Helena: Okay. As Google.

269
00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.200
Lisa Galea: drive now.

270
00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.330
Helena: drive thing. So once you share that with me.

271
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:30.739
Lisa Galea: I'm gonna.

272
00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.209
Helena: I'll share that with her, and she can…

273
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:33.850
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

274
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.469
Helena: Whizbang, whatever, and put it in the…

275
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:42.100
Lisa Galea: Do you guys have, you have

276
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:48.660
Lisa Galea: Notion accounts, because I always didn't know what email to use, or I can invite you just with your normal email.

277
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:56.790
Helena: No, I don't have a Notion account. It's free, it's free, so I'll just invite you, and then you click and you'll be in, do you know what I mean? Oh, okay, cool.

278
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.740
Lisa Galea: Nike.

279
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.879
Lisa Galea: That's why I don't really want… I just don't think anyone wants more things to do.

280
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.680
Helena: Good news.

281
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.440
Lisa Galea: You know, we don't. We don't want more jobs, more apps.

282
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:07.480
Helena: No.

283
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.740
Lisa Galea: Don't ask me to go into another portal.

284
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:17.969
Lisa Galea: So there you go! That's why I love that way of sharing it, because it's like, I've got a client, there you go, have a look at this information for you, we don't have to log in.

285
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.349
Lisa Galea: But we do also want to make sure that if you're…

286
00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:32.959
Lisa Galea: If you've got a team, I saw last night what AI… ChatGPT is bringing in Agentiv, where you can pretty much bring… make what you're doing and make AI in ChatGPT.

287
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:39.839
Lisa Galea: Which means every single person in your team can do that, so they're… you talk about silos, they're gonna be making their own little chains of jobs.

288
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.949
Lisa Galea: And if you don't have rules.

289
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.440
Lisa Galea: That could be going any old round.

290
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:47.809
Lisa Galea: of the aspberries.

291
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:48.370
Helena: Excuse me.

292
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:55.610
Lisa Galea: So, I will create… let me share this now… I'll share, make sure I put you on it. I have got you on it, I just haven't given you…

293
00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.920
Lisa Galea: And I'll put it in the chat now, so you've got it.

294
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.490
Lisa Galea: And then I also… We'll put it on our Notion boards.

295
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:15.250
Lisa Galea: That we've got it. I work in two-week sprints to do with the moon. I'm feeling like that that's what ladies should do instead of 24-hour sprints.

296
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:22.989
Lisa Galea: But I've got that on there, so… I'm putting notes on here, and I've also got, then.

297
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.610
Lisa Galea: Our mission this week…

298
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:30.879
Lisa Galea: Get really clear on what that is, is to make sure we know why we're doing this.

299
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.819
Lisa Galea: What outcomes we are… like, this is written down.

300
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.129
Lisa Galea: And get as much of that brand strategy.

301
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:42.400
Lisa Galea: The brand architecture and your identity and what we've got.

302
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:46.199
Lisa Galea: Together. So we can look at it and go, okay, where are we at?

303
00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:51.479
Lisa Galea: So, you've got that, we're getting the details, we're getting that in, we can do

304
00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.109
Lisa Galea: I'll keep that for the week.

305
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.830
Helena: We've also done a priority of output list.

306
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:59.850
Lisa Galea: You have?

307
00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:00.450
Helena: Yeah.

308
00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:06.850
Lisa Galea: Excellent. Is that handy? Very handy. And everything's handy, because then it means… that's why it's like we keep

309
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.950
Lisa Galea: you know.

310
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:13.299
Helena: We speak from all different perspectives, that's why it's like, I know my stuff, but I need to know your questions.

311
00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:13.900
Helena: Yes.

312
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:22.629
Lisa Galea: So, what matters most in terms of levers in the next, sort of, 12 months, let's say 12… I'm not a big 10-year planner.

313
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:36.640
Lisa Galea: But, say, 12 or 18 months, is it getting new market share, or is it getting increasing income, or serving accounts? What would you say out of those three is your biggest goal, most important thing?

314
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:48.080
Helena: Definitely growing in the domestic market, but our customer channels and decision makers Have kind of changed.

315
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.749
Helena: We're doing a lot more with building groups.

316
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:58.179
Helena: End distributors, and less with end users.

317
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.219
Lisa Galea: Yeah, okay.

318
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.130
Helena: And then we've got, our export.

319
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.710
Lisa Galea: So, you really want to grow your market share.

320
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:09.730
Helena: Yep.

321
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.580
Lisa Galea: The main goal for the next, sort of, the next 12… 12 to 18 month goal.

322
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.779
Helena: Yeah, it's market share.

323
00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.979
Lisa Galea: Yeah, it's increased much.

324
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.310
Lisa Galea: this one.

325
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:29.549
Lisa Galea: Is there any blockers that you see right now? What are the blockers? And, like, I'll ask both of you to say, what blockers do you see in achieving that goal right now?

326
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.680
Lisa Galea: To gain market share.

327
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:47.980
Helena: No… Maybe… Ow… how do I say… how do I say this?

328
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.230
Helena: Ow.

329
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.080
Helena: external facing… brand.

330
00:26:54.190 --> 00:27:06.100
Helena: doesn't reflect the standard of work we do. So when decision makers skim past our staff, Doesn't actually reflect

331
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.700
Helena: The quality and the high-level services that we provide people.

332
00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:11.450
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

333
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:19.879
Helena: Like, it's almost a little bit… because we don't have a super strict 6-12 month external marketing plan.

334
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:24.349
Helena: It's kind of… things that do go external are a little bit higgledy-piggledy.

335
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.250
Lisa Galea: The messaging's not…

336
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.649
Helena: The messaging's not clear.

337
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:28.580
Lisa Galea: clarity yet.

338
00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.539
Helena: Yeah, and the messaging is very…

339
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:40.769
Helena: I, from what I can see, is very angled towards the end users in medical equipment.

340
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:41.540
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

341
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:47.219
Helena: But… That isn't necessarily the decision, the main decision maker.

342
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.670
Lisa Galea: Anymore.

343
00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.119
Lisa Galea: What about you?

344
00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:09.690
Isabelle: I definitely think consistency with the messages we're trying to get out there, that we are a premium product, we are good at what we do, and we do everything to a very high standard, is not always

345
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:14.649
Isabelle: come across, like, I think some of the decision makers are seeing us as…

346
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:22.020
Isabelle: Sort of mum and pop shop, just, like, not as high a standard as we are.

347
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.530
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

348
00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:32.539
Isabelle: So that's one. And then, yeah, the consistency, and maybe also communication to our customers maybe could be better how we communicate with them.

349
00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.180
Isabelle: Whether it's direct or through distributors as well.

350
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:37.999
Isabelle: Could be more clear.

351
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:38.710
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

352
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.210
Isabelle: So, more structured communication.

353
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.169
Lisa Galea: And also more value-add, because they'll be the one sharing your brand. Value added, yeah.

354
00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:53.210
Helena: they're the brand messages. Yeah, like, what assets can we give them so that they're more than that?

355
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:53.780
Helena: Hmm.

356
00:28:53.780 --> 00:29:04.399
Lisa Galea: So, when we're talking about setting up our team for success, that's why I think it's, like, employee experience, customer experience. You all come together. The brand experience is those people.

357
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:05.770
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

358
00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.339
Helena: All stakeholders.

359
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:12.089
Lisa Galea: stakeholders, and I think, you know, when people say it's nothing about it, it's how I even talk to my…

360
00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.929
Lisa Galea: Like, the respect I give to my delivery man builds my brand.

361
00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.469
Lisa Galea: Because I'm not in integrity with my values, you know, like…

362
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.930
Helena: Yeah.

363
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.180
Lisa Galea: One would hope I'm always curious and fun.

364
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.650
Lisa Galea: I think I am, I'm good for that.

365
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:32.199
Lisa Galea: So that is… that's cool. I actually have just realized, like, it's clicked more, because when I work

366
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.520
Lisa Galea: Like, a lot with builders.

367
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:38.730
Lisa Galea: they have had that gap where they're going for those Tier 2 projects.

368
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:49.020
Lisa Galea: But they're… and they're capable. Like, they're doing really well in business, but they haven't had time to bother with the website, they haven't had time to do all the stuff, and because they're actually good.

369
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:53.670
Lisa Galea: That's why they haven't had to bother, because they're still doing a great job, so they've got work.

370
00:29:53.810 --> 00:30:04.960
Lisa Galea: But it's like, when they go into those corp… when they get to that level, you've got to put in all your capability statements, you've got to put in all the things, and you just do not fit in the group, because they look like…

371
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:11.660
Lisa Galea: Mum and dads, they look like a single-owned business. And everyone else, it looks like a leadership comp… you know, like a…

372
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.530
Lisa Galea: Premium Builder.

373
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.390
Lisa Galea: So that's… that is a problem for them, so we do, like, a brand makeover.

374
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.260
Lisa Galea: Not… because we're not changing the logo or doing anything, it's just…

375
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:29.830
Helena: And it's probably really good timing, because I know Odette, I think, is it through Odoo, Isabel, working on the new website?

376
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:37.669
Helena: Yeah, so she's doing a website refresh, so we just want to make sure before that goes external that we're all on the same page.

377
00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:47.009
Lisa Galea: My bots are so amazing at this, you will not believe it. The communication thing is super cool, I love them. Nellie's my friend.

378
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:56.840
Lisa Galea: And I have built, like, I did an MBA in, body language and communication over Christmas, and so I've got one botch. I don't even know what to do with me so far.

379
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.290
Lisa Galea: So, he pretty much…

380
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:07.019
Lisa Galea: It just makes me look good all the time. And it also will help us, like, that once you get really clear on what you want.

381
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:14.240
Lisa Galea: That's why I feel we'll achieve it, because if we've got that really clear who we're serving, what we're making things for…

382
00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:28.440
Lisa Galea: you can start making AI pump out some stuff pretty quick. That's useful, it's not just garbage. Alright, so, that's an excellent… now I actually see why you need this from a brand perspective, because I am, like, saying to people, oh my god, they're, like.

383
00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.859
Lisa Galea: They just got Australian of the Year.

384
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:37.550
Lisa Galea: Like, they're the manufacturer, premium manufacturer in Australia, but you're…

385
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.799
Lisa Galea: How your dress doesn't look that way.

386
00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.339
Lisa Galea: When people just see you.

387
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:49.019
Lisa Galea: But your actual internal strength, I feel, is totally fine. That's why I was like, I'm not really worried too much about…

388
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.460
Lisa Galea: your brand vision, because I'm sure your dad's got one.

389
00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.250
Helena: Yeah.

390
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.579
Lisa Galea: By a gentleman, it's just not being talked about properly.

391
00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:57.910
Helena: Yes, and.

392
00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:58.790
Lisa Galea: And in a knee.

393
00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:02.950
Helena: It's not noted anywhere that we can go and share it.

394
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.560
Lisa Galea: That's what we're telling them what to think.

395
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:12.889
Lisa Galea: That's what we want to do. It's like, we are not guiding them. It's happening, your branding, just by shaking hands with someone.

396
00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:19.489
Lisa Galea: But really, we want to guide them and tell them, because our brains are wallies, and so if they have those key words.

397
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:20.260
Helena: Never one.

398
00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.649
Lisa Galea: the internal language, once you can…

399
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:31.439
Lisa Galea: once you have it, it's like when I… the reason I sort of moved into company culture was it's almost like you're running an ad campaign.

400
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:41.710
Lisa Galea: internally to change the language, and you have to start with changing that top… like, telling the top team, these are the words I want you to start saying. Right.

401
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:42.110
Helena: Yeah.

402
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.130
Lisa Galea: things.

403
00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:52.449
Lisa Galea: we work as a company. So then everyone, they go in to have a coffee, their brand vision should be in front of them as something they can go.

404
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.619
Lisa Galea: Like, you know, boom, boom, boom, this is what we do.

405
00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:02.440
Helena: really wanna… lift from… buy from Emery.

406
00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:02.780
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

407
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.200
Helena: to work with Emery.

408
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.079
Lisa Galea: That's what we are.

409
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:11.810
Helena: An extension of your business as the distributors and as the builders, and…

410
00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:19.169
Helena: whatnot. Yes, we still have the hospitals buying one or two trolleys and a couple of IV poles, like, they can still buy off us.

411
00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:23.660
Helena: But… The bigger guys that lock in

412
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:30.249
Helena: projects, millions and millions of dollars. We want to work with them. We don't want them to buy off us.

413
00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:31.360
Lisa Galea: Yet.

414
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.830
Lisa Galea: And I do think, as well, that market…

415
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.670
Helena: Changing that wording to work with us?

416
00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:41.400
Lisa Galea: Here's our products, like, from a product model to a service model.

417
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.660
Lisa Galea: Yeah, and you'.

418
00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.289
Helena: I think taking it to the next.

419
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:51.380
Lisa Galea: Lovely. You're very… you're almost very similar to… because you're manufacturing, you're similar to HPP, and…

420
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:53.570
Lisa Galea: Working with them for 17 years.

421
00:33:54.130 --> 00:34:00.680
Lisa Galea: I know these things, so I get it. That's fine, that is good, when…

422
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:11.370
Lisa Galea: Is there anything negative that you're seeing, like, people are saying, or you think within the company that is a problem, that's like…

423
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:18.399
Lisa Galea: Because of this, this is really causing an issue, or it's, like, internal like that, a little termite or anything that you can see.

424
00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.480
Lisa Galea: Just so we know.

425
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:37.129
Helena: There's some people who are not here, so it's fine, that are probably not as bored in taking on new technology and new systems and new ways and whatnot, so I know some of this stuff is going to freak them out.

426
00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:43.949
Helena: So we also need to make sure that the way we introduce it is to not… Is it softly, softly?

427
00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.739
Lisa Galea: Threatening, it's not threatening.

428
00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:46.459
Helena: Yes.

429
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:54.250
Lisa Galea: And would you say that it is that, that they're afraid of losing their jobs because they think technology's gonna take over? Yeah.

430
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:59.460
Lisa Galea: We can do that, because that's what Pip does. He influences people to get what you want.

431
00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.860
Helena: Oh, good.

432
00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.739
Lisa Galea: Because it's like, if you say it in a different way.

433
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.020
Lisa Galea: Changes how people think about it.

434
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:17.940
Lisa Galea: That's all we need to do is frame it so, you know, that they can see that gap. Alright, that's good. Excellent, excellent. So…

435
00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.790
Helena: Let me see if I can…

436
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.790
Helena: Where do you want me to put this?

437
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.720
Lisa Galea: I have given you a Google Drive link.

438
00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.680
Helena: Oh, okay, cool, I can do that. I'll just pop these in here in case.

439
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.299
Helena: If there's anything that…

440
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:37.529
Lisa Galea: So, really now, at the moment, we are gonna… I'm gonna do a really quick customer, like, overview.

441
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:45.349
Lisa Galea: So, who is signing the contracts and is, like, you know, living with the outcomes of dealing with you?

442
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:55.170
Helena: So we probably… But, we have, I'm gonna say, 3 main customer pillars.

443
00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:03.740
Helena: Where we have our, distributors as one, which can be domestically and globally.

444
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:10.270
Helena: we have our… Builders that we tender.

445
00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:18.350
Helena: To, and work with, with builders slash architects, slash plumbers, whatever, like, that whole group of people.

446
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.210
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

447
00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:23.420
Helena: And then we have our… End user, customer group.

448
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.559
Helena: Which are our nurses and doctors and whatever.

449
00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:30.770
Lisa Galea: Yep.

450
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:39.049
Lisa Galea: Your dad mentioned sterilisation was really your specialty area. Is that in Australia, or overseas, or it's everywhere?

451
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:50.199
Helena: Everywhere. Both. Yeah, so we went to the US, and we went to the HSPA, which is what they call their CSD, which is Central Sterilization Department, or something like that.

452
00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:56.130
Helena: Spd, there's his. And…

453
00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.580
Helena: That was the biggest conference I've ever been to.

454
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.149
Helena: And it's definitely something that is, like, our… our specialty.

455
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.600
Lisa Galea: And we.

456
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.009
Helena: But it's not our only…

457
00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:09.380
Lisa Galea: Yes.

458
00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.200
Helena: Specialty, if that makes sense.

459
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.100
Lisa Galea: Okay.

460
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:24.389
Lisa Galea: Well, this is good, we'll keep through this. That's good, that's good. Now, so what pains are they having? Why do they need you? I mean, obviously, you're making the equipment, but why are they calling you to make it?

461
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:33.030
Helena: A lot of people come to us for the customization, instead of making something.

462
00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:36.650
Helena: work. We can make it work for them.

463
00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:37.460
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

464
00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:42.170
Helena: And I guess people know our quality.

465
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.510
Helena: And we're just fortunate that

466
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:56.010
Helena: a couple of our big competitors bring in cheap shit from China. So, if you get the right person making the right decisions, well, then they're not going to want that.

467
00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:56.640
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

468
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:03.520
Lisa Galea: Okay.

469
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.860
Lisa Galea: And then when they get your stuff.

470
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:16.739
Lisa Galea: what's the difference from getting it from… they don't have any problems, it's because of the quality of what you've put in? Like, what's the outcome for them compared to your comps?

471
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.360
Helena: So, because a lot of our custom stuff is

472
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:32.700
Helena: approved and changed and edited for exactly what they need. We've got our in-house engineers that work with them on the different drawings and whatnot. They know what they're getting when it arrives.

473
00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:34.980
Helena: And…

474
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.529
Helena: I don't know, all of our stuff. Our big stuff arrives on casters and stuff, so it's easy to move, and they don't have to flat pack anything, it all arrives fully assembled.

475
00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:49.940
Helena: Israel, can you think of anything else?

476
00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:58.280
Isabelle: Yeah, so everything we do arrives fully assembled. There's no need

477
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:11.879
Isabelle: for flat packing, as Helena said, from, like, a lot of our competitors, there's a bit of assembly on site they need to do, whereas they just roll our stuff in and plumb it in, or plug it into the wall, and it's good to go.

478
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.499
Isabelle: We also… we also help them, because…

479
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:24.689
Isabelle: Normally, our big ticket items are obviously our height adjustable sinks and pack stations, so CSSD.

480
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:37.890
Isabelle: They are usually shoved in a back corner somewhere in a hospital, and the configuration of the rooms, so that's where our customization products come in, that we can configure stuff to suit their workflow, to suit their rooms.

481
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.599
Lisa Galea: Yeah. Because that really makes a difference, yeah.

482
00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.249
Lisa Galea: You optimize the space for them.

483
00:39:43.500 --> 00:40:01.520
Isabelle: Yeah. And get things to work, and most of our new ideas actually come from the customers themselves, because they've had a tricky situation, or they've needed something to work in an odd spot, or, you know, something like that, so we customize for them to make it work for them.

484
00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:02.900
Lisa Galea: Yeah, perfect.

485
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:09.490
Lisa Galea: customers always have the best ideas, that's why I think working with you guys to achieve an outcome for a brand sprint is so important.

486
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:09.870
Isabelle: judgment.

487
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.790
Lisa Galea: than doing it on their own, because

488
00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:16.090
Lisa Galea: I would take forever to go and find out sterilization.

489
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:30.450
Lisa Galea: And I just ask your dad, and he's telling me info, and he's like, why wouldn't I work like that with you, not for you? You know, like, that's how you want people to feel. I'm on your team, I want you to win. To be honest, I don't think I've ever worked for someone where they've lost money.

490
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.120
Lisa Galea: I mean, if I'm costing you money, I'm doing my job wrong.

491
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:41.320
Lisa Galea: Like, I'm like, that's my job, is to make you money, and marketing shouldn't cost that much money, like, I shouldn't be…

492
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:53.440
Lisa Galea: I shouldn't be all your budget, mate. You are choosing the wrong person, if that's the case. Alright. So, why do you think they really… do you think they really pick you over…

493
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:59.600
Lisa Galea: the customization, or is it really because of the quality? What's really making their lives easy while they pick you?

494
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:12.749
Helena: I think it definitely plays into the quality, but also the Australian-made has a big pool. I'm not 100% sure on what the percentage needs to be, but of

495
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:17.760
Helena: The new builds a certain amount of the products or equipment or whatever.

496
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:23.239
Helena: let's just, for example, because I don't know the number, 20% of that has to be from an Australian

497
00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:28.179
Helena: company. Yeah. Or whatever, so we can fulfill

498
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.490
Helena: That part of what they have to do with the government.

499
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.170
Helena: Huh. Which is…

500
00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.359
Lisa Galea: So it's not what they want, it's like a handy thing for them.

501
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:50.979
Helena: Like, we, yeah, like, we tick that box for them, and, with our capability statement, all of our sustainability and recycling or whatnot gives them

502
00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:52.110
Helena: points.

503
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:59.569
Helena: To… especially with the building groups, to build their package together, we add more value than just a product.

504
00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:00.410
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

505
00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:07.769
Lisa Galea: Because you're sorting out, and you're solving those problems, like, that they need to get their buildings past the thing.

506
00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:08.460
Helena: Yeah.

507
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:16.869
Lisa Galea: Get it? Excellent. Excellent. So that is, they care, these people, because… and you're not communicating that you're selling to those people.

508
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.910
Helena: -

509
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.270
Lisa Galea: the skill I like.

510
00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.919
Lisa Galea: This is the catalogue and buy it.

511
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:27.680
Helena: Yeah, there's no work with us, there's no vis-a- services, there's no wins actually what we can do.

512
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:35.249
Lisa Galea: So, what tier are the people you're… are they, like, Tier 1 or 2? Do you know what tier builders they are? They've all got this tier number.

513
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:38.910
Helena: Isona.

514
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:48.070
Isabelle: We have done some Tier 1 customer, Tier 1 builders, and… but majority… Like, I'd say, like, we're…

515
00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:54.139
Isabelle: 30% Tier 1, 70 cents, depend… The percent is Tier 2.

516
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:56.129
Lisa Galea: I think we do work with…

517
00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.589
Isabelle: What if we could get…

518
00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:07.260
Isabelle: to the Tier 1s. It'd be great if we could, like, the big multiplex, and the lend-lease, and you know, those big ones.

519
00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.580
Isabelle: John… John Holland's narrative, too, so…

520
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.130
Helena: We just had John Holland come in for a tour this afternoon.

521
00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:18.370
Helena: Which was really good, and they were really impressed.

522
00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:19.360
Isabelle: Yeah.

523
00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.769
Helena: But that is the first building group we have had through the.

524
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:24.570
Lisa Galea: So, your… our goal is to be Tier 1?

525
00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.400
Helena: We want to supply to you.

526
00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.369
Lisa Galea: At the moment, you're… 70%, that's it. You're 70% because you're excellent.

527
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:37.820
Lisa Galea: And so you're Tier 2. We want to… our real goal is to get us up to… we fit in.

528
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:40.819
Lisa Galea: with the people who are bidding to Lendlease.

529
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:42.650
Helena: Yeah, we're not the poor cousin anymore.

530
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:47.939
Lisa Galea: Yeah, we are actually not the… like, we stand out even in that group.

531
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:48.950
Helena: Yeah.

532
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:50.589
Lisa Galea: And that's what we.

533
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:51.870
Helena: to tell them.

534
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:57.110
Lisa Galea: Need to tell them. The top 3 companies who were, like, in… I can't remember what it's called, but you know, like, how…

535
00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:03.400
Lisa Galea: people… the top 3 companies, I think, that won worldwide, were all family-based last year.

536
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:04.980
Helena: Oh, good.

537
00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.800
Lisa Galea: I watched, yeah, going through the behavioural, there's, like, a coffett…

538
00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:12.150
Lisa Galea: conference nudge Tech, and they were saying it's…

539
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:18.430
Lisa Galea: Because you have a lot more room to pivot, you do a lot more little side projects to explore…

540
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:19.950
Helena: their decisions.

541
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:24.719
Lisa Galea: And the experimenting allows you to… Have more things going on.

542
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:31.000
Lisa Galea: But that is good, because it's not going… that talking to Tier 1 isn't going to stop you getting Tier 2.

543
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.850
Helena: No.

544
00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:35.530
Lisa Galea: still solving all your customer problems.

545
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:43.749
Helena: So, that's good. So that's one pillar of our customers, and then our distributors is another pillar.

546
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.940
Helena: Which is a big pillar.

547
00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.680
Lisa Galea: Okay.

548
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:51.159
Lisa Galea: And that's… Who are they?

549
00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:58.150
Helena: So, like, there's a group called Gintingi. You can ask me how to spell that, and I've got no idea how to. There's one called Asatin.

550
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.520
Helena: It's about Yogan after.

551
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:11.200
Isabelle: Gatigi and Appenden are sort of our biggest ones, and then we have smaller distributors as well, like, Imaging Solutions.

552
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.530
Helena: DoubleS and stuff.

553
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.860
Isabelle: SCSS is the distributor.

554
00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.769
Isabelle: We've got DB Health, we've got…

555
00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:22.350
Lisa Galea: I don't… I did it, I ran…

556
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:23.920
Isabelle: Sort of… yeah.

557
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:29.629
Lisa Galea: I saw them, they wanted a database built for price.

558
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:30.290
Isabelle: Jeez.

559
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:35.770
Lisa Galea: I know who they are. So they're basically, like, other people like you, but who are specialized in their area.

560
00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:37.520
Isabelle: Distributing your product.

561
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.170
Helena: Yeah, and we're a bolt-on to their service, so that they.

562
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:40.900
Lisa Galea: Again.

563
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:41.840
Helena: luggage more.

564
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:51.050
Lisa Galea: Do we need to target them, or is your communication, really not aimed at them, because they're there already?

565
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:57.469
Helena: we have a lot of room to grow with our big distributors, like Gintengi and Atherton.

566
00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:02.160
Helena: domestically, and Gintengi is huge internationally.

567
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.560
Lisa Galea: So you don't need more of them, you need to give them information.

568
00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.369
Helena: We need more from those ones. Yeah.

569
00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:17.540
Lisa Galea: So we're not looking for… with Tier 1, it was like, we want more, but with this one, we're like, we're looking to serve these people, because if we serve these people properly.

570
00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:18.139
Helena: We'll get more.

571
00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.810
Lisa Galea: You didn't even need to get other ones, do you know what I mean?

572
00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:21.230
Helena: Yeah.

573
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:22.420
Lisa Galea: They're that, yeah, cool.

574
00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.590
Lisa Galea: Excellent-y. Here's another one?

575
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.190
Helena: Ecolab, is that one?

576
00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:41.469
Isabelle: We'd like to get them back on board, so they… we had Ecolab or Gale quite a few years ago, and then they signed an exclusivity contract with a competitor of ours, so they were with them, and they're…

577
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.500
Isabelle: the contracts.

578
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.110
Lisa Galea: Amazing.

579
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:43.580
Isabelle: her belly.

580
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:44.130
Lisa Galea: Check.

581
00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.160
Lisa Galea: Small.

582
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:45.720
Isabelle: fine.

583
00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:51.049
Helena: The Chinese Flat Pact.

584
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:52.250
Isabelle: Oh, yeah.

585
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.870
Lisa Galea: Lucky.

586
00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.480
Isabelle: And then, yeah, like, we had another…

587
00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:07.960
Isabelle: possible distributor visit us, Paragon, or the CH2 people, so we'd like to get them on board, as well as their premium range of their product lines.

588
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:19.440
Lisa Galea: And again, with them anyway, what we're… what we're doing in terms of making you… you look fitted in that Tier 1, they want anyway, because then it's easier for them to sell you.

589
00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:34.660
Helena: Yes, and some of the times, like today, when John Holland came around, he also brought the Gintingi guy, who has won their contract, but our products are being supplied to John Holland through Gintingi. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine, got ya.

590
00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.910
Lisa Galea: So really, with the distributors, you are…

591
00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:43.400
Lisa Galea: We need to talk to them, but really, we're… you're both serving the same human.

592
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:44.940
Helena: Yes.

593
00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:51.960
Lisa Galea: Yeah, you're both selling the same unit, but you just do different things, so you just want to set them up for success to sell your product.

594
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:54.229
Helena: Yes, we need them to have more…

595
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.740
Lisa Galea: Know what you've got, and they can actually sell it.

596
00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:57.620
Helena: Yeah.

597
00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:58.470
Lisa Galea: Okay?

598
00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:06.310
Lisa Galea: And… okay, so… Is there any confusion about what you do, or is it just…

599
00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:11.599
Lisa Galea: they don't really realize your capacity, is what I'm seeing, but is there any other…

600
00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.559
Helena: Realize our capacity, and also don't.

601
00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.570
Helena: Understand.

602
00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.670
Helena: the, the,

603
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:27.089
Helena: options with the customization. Like, they kind of go, oh, we aren't, like, makes sense that you can make that table a bit longer.

604
00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:31.109
Helena: But it's like, no, we can do whatever you want to that table.

605
00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:35.419
Helena: like… And that's clearly not.

606
00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:45.820
Helena: Out there as much, and that might be a… an industry understanding of Customization of these products.

607
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:48.859
Lisa Galea: Yeah, you've got to educate them on what actually.

608
00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:55.859
Helena: what we can actually do. What it means, what you're saying, and what you can do, because it doesn't… that could mean anything, like, I make table legs longer.

609
00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:04.259
Lisa Galea: But you're really designing the room with them and supporting them for success through the whole journey, not just about the product. It's about the workflow, about how.

610
00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:04.840
Helena: Yeah.

611
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.570
Lisa Galea: Making sure that it's useful.

612
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:07.160
Helena: Yes.

613
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.459
Lisa Galea: Is there one thing?

614
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.919
Lisa Galea: that you could say, I could credibly promise about our stuff, that we're like, that's it.

615
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:19.739
Lisa Galea: There's one thing that's so different about us that makes us that.

616
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:28.269
Helena: Oh, if you're talking… CSD products.

617
00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:35.200
Helena: It would probably be, like, if we're talking sinks and against our main competitor.

618
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:41.869
Helena: A big selling point is it arrives fully assembled… fully assembled.

619
00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:54.690
Lisa Galea: Because it would be like IKEA that I'm putting the wheels on. I bet in every one it's like IKEA with wheels and floppy little sides, and I'm trying to do the thing together.

620
00:49:54.690 --> 00:50:05.290
Helena: And lots of, like, dirty little corners and stuff that they can't clean properly and whatnot. And I think probably our standards. We don't just meet the standards, our standards are actually

621
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:07.249
Helena: We are now.

622
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:12.860
Helena: global standards, not just Australian standards.

623
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:23.249
Lisa Galea: I… the market, after I worked… when I was looking at your stuff last time, I went into the market, if you got into these American markets, and I was like, oh my god.

624
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:29.930
Helena: the money, if you've got a one… I was like, what would they… what would they make? Because I was like, this just doesn't make sense with AI, what's the value?

625
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:31.150
Helena: alike.

626
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:32.470
Lisa Galea: It was a lot.

627
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.840
Helena: Yeah.

628
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.849
Lisa Galea: Even if you only got fifth, like, 0.5% of that market.

629
00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.170
Lisa Galea: It… it was… mental.

630
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:40.900
Helena: Yeah.

631
00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.019
Lisa Galea: And they actually love…

632
00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.570
Helena: Oh, yes.

633
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:48.459
Lisa Galea: Massive advantage, because we have low brand trust at the moment.

634
00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:49.740
Helena: Hmm.

635
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:50.910
Lisa Galea: That's because…

636
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:59.769
Lisa Galea: it's like… So much brand… no brand trust. So, that is… in Australia, it's like, we are really trusted globally.

637
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:05.989
Lisa Galea: In Canada, you just said good day, and people were nice to you. It was a crazy thing.

638
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:10.130
Helena: called us the Australian Barbies at the conference.

639
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.520
Lisa Galea: charging.

640
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.800
Helena: America, yeah.

641
00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:13.569
Lisa Galea: Well, they love us.

642
00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:17.879
Helena: I said, if you buy something off me, you can call me whatever you want. I don't care.

643
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:21.839
Lisa Galea: They would love that too! I'm sure it was like, it's crazy, so…

644
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:35.339
Lisa Galea: Excellent, so I think we can really get a basic overview of what we've got today. You're going to give me what you've got in colours and stuff like that, so I'm going to lay that out and do that job for you, because I think that would be easier, so I can just make the picture.

645
00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:35.730
Helena: Yeah.

646
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:40.609
Lisa Galea: I was gonna get us to grab it. I think it's just easier if I lay it out, and then next meeting, we can…

647
00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:55.979
Lisa Galea: look at it, otherwise our brains will fry. But we have really got a good… we've got a good… we know roughly… I think we know where we're going and what we want to do. I do want to know, so when this sprint finishes, our big picture goals.

648
00:51:56.310 --> 00:52:03.659
Lisa Galea: That is in middle… you're going away middle of November, for a conference, sort of end of November.

649
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.190
Helena: Yeah.

650
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:07.219
Lisa Galea: What are those dates, Isabel? Do you know them?

651
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:10.970
Helena: We live on the 28th of November.

652
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:14.620
Lisa Galea: So alcohol's, like, a week before, right?

653
00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:16.919
Helena: Yeah, the 28th. Yeah, if we could have that.

654
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:18.850
Helena: young.

655
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:26.479
Lisa Galea: I'm aiming for, like, 6 weeks, which was, like, mid, I think it was mid, but… Oh, okay. That's when I'm, like, I'm on it, because I was, like, at the

656
00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:33.189
Lisa Galea: in my brain, so I know that that's when I was going for, so that's good. I'm not going to say, oh, no, it doesn't matter, we've got two extra weeks, because we haven't

657
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:42.520
Lisa Galea: Because I do want to know who is your target in… at that conference, because that's who I really want to make sure we're ready for, even if we.

658
00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.230
Helena: distributors.

659
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:44.050
Lisa Galea: shut down.

660
00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.820
Lisa Galea: Okay, the distributors.

661
00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:53.980
Helena: because it's a, it's Hong Kong's turn to host the world sterilisation.

662
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.169
Lisa Galea: And it is really focusing on sterilisation.

663
00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:06.050
Helena: Yeah. Yeah. Like, we want a global international distributor, and might not necessarily even be

664
00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:08.839
Helena: someone based in Hong Kong.

665
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:11.690
Helena: It just happens to be where the conference is.

666
00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.089
Lisa Galea: Yeah, yeah, yeah, they've all come, hopefully.

667
00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:17.780
Helena: They've all… hopefully they've all come from over, yeah.

668
00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.690
Lisa Galea: I do, I don't say before.

669
00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:22.210
Isabelle: or the conference was in Chile.

670
00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:23.440
Lisa Galea: Okay.

671
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:34.120
Isabelle: So, I don't know where it's gonna be next year. So, the year before that, was it in Los… no, that was at the other conference. The American conference was in Las Vegas the year before.

672
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:35.000
Isabelle: Yeah.

673
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.479
Lisa Galea: So we want to go to this conference.

674
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:40.799
Lisa Galea: And show your capabilities to distributors.

675
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:45.800
Helena: We want a huge, almost us-wearing t-shirt saying, work with us.

676
00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:46.490
Lisa Galea: Yeah.

677
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:48.130
Helena: Yep.

678
00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:49.490
Lisa Galea: I'm an Aussie Barbie.

679
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:52.209
Helena: I'm an Aussie, Barbie. Maybe we should get Barbie dolls.

680
00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:58.959
Lisa Galea: If that's what works, we'll be doing it, but I think we won't need to do that, my friend. Work with us is good.

681
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:14.329
Lisa Galea: But I do think, like, with even, you know, like, just getting that language out and communicating in the right way, you… you're gonna win the game. The sterilization, I feel, though, we really need to… I think we should specialize in that, like.

682
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:18.869
Lisa Galea: Because… even I was thinking, when you said about corners.

683
00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:31.089
Lisa Galea: you guys obviously know all this stuff, but people wouldn't be thinking, well, yeah, I've just put it together myself, and because I put it together myself, I've now got a shitty corner where it's not sterilized.

684
00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:43.460
Lisa Galea: Yes. Hard to sterilize, okay? So again, your manufacturing processes are aligned with sterilization, because having sealed corners and having that is why you're the best.

685
00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:44.510
Helena: Yes.

686
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:46.659
Lisa Galea: This is really your one thing.

687
00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.450
Lisa Galea: Because you're manufacturing cabinets, obviously loads of things.

688
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:58.139
Lisa Galea: You can do other things, it's just because most people are wallies, so we need to make sure they know only.

689
00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:58.960
Helena: they know.

690
00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:05.130
Lisa Galea: But even when you said it, I was like, they probably don't realize that, that when they're making an IKEA kit.

691
00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:11.449
Lisa Galea: You could show them a visual diagram of where the germs are forming, do you know what I mean?

692
00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:12.260
Helena: Yeah.

693
00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:17.229
Lisa Galea: And be like, look at this in the corner, like, hi, imagined you immediately.

694
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.050
Lisa Galea: with one of those lights, like, you know when they're hotels from…

695
00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.919
Helena: Yeah, the glowing light.

696
00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:29.380
Lisa Galea: You want one. You want to go over and go, and then everyone would want, like, your shit. She'd be like, I don't want Jones.

697
00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:30.040
Helena: None.

698
00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:37.609
Lisa Galea: And obviously with COVID and all the things that we've got, there's so many places, countries preparing for more.

699
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:38.649
Helena: Of that.

700
00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:40.609
Lisa Galea: I think we will have more problems in the future.

701
00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:41.230
Helena: Hmm.

702
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:56.619
Lisa Galea: Yeah, my darling. But I think they care about sterilization, because we… I just thought it was a joke in COVID, because when you do uni and your science uni, you can't have germs in your experiment, because you're going to mess things up. And I was like, this is a joke, there's germs everywhere.

703
00:55:57.590 --> 00:56:08.259
Lisa Galea: this is not working, the mask thing, that's just ridiculous that you think that's sterile. Mike's, like, wearing a mask and then putting his keys in his pocket, touching everything, and I'm just like, germs, germs, germs!

704
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:19.490
Lisa Galea: So, I think that the, it… well, we're not going to make a decision, because we're exploring, pushing boundaries. I mean, I really want to make sure I go and… I'll go and do some reporting.

705
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:28.709
Lisa Galea: I think because of our speed thing, it's that if I do the reporting, then I share the prompts, so you see the questions I'm asking, and the way I'm doing that.

706
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:35.869
Lisa Galea: And we're not just expecting you to know the shit before we've started, and then I can show you the results, and we'll work from there.

707
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:36.770
Helena: Okay.

708
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:41.770
Lisa Galea: The only one other thing I wanted to show you quickly on my list, which was for AI.

709
00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:44.460
Lisa Galea: We've done very well, girls.

710
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:46.509
Lisa Galea: Oh, that's a lot of questions.

711
00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:55.389
Lisa Galea: But really, we're setting seeds, and once we do and see what are the customers, what is your competition great at, and what are they shit at.

712
00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:56.330
Helena: Hmm.

713
00:56:56.330 --> 00:57:04.950
Lisa Galea: I want to know that, so then we can start making better decisions. But because you will find there's a lot of information… am I back on share? Let's Sherry, sharey, I'm not, am I?

714
00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:06.030
Helena: Not yet.

715
00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:14.200
Lisa Galea: Get rid of our Gantt chart that makes me look like a nerd.

716
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:18.699
Lisa Galea: Here we go! We have got… so say I'm doing market…

717
00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.249
Lisa Galea: I was doing market research on retreats.

718
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:26.100
Lisa Galea: Getting a bit carried away, I know, well, there's a lot of information we can find out online.

719
00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:30.220
Lisa Galea: And what's cool is, these notebooks hold, like, 3,000 pages.

720
00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:32.050
Helena: Huh.

721
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:35.319
Lisa Galea: But if you notice, when I'm doing it, so I've chucked it all in.

722
00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:39.059
Lisa Galea: If you've got documents as well, you can just run, like.

723
00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.719
Lisa Galea: get them made into PDFs, do you know what I mean? Because it doesn't like Word docs.

724
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:47.819
Lisa Galea: But it's basically, imagine your notebook, you can have as many as you want.

725
00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.799
Lisa Galea: And what I'm doing is, when I'm doing the research.

726
00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:56.799
Lisa Galea: you could then go Save to Note, and it comes over here. Do you see that I'm keeping…

727
00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:04.660
Lisa Galea: the information I found out from all the stuff. First of all, I go and look in there, and then I'm like, go and find this out, go and find this out.

728
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:07.920
Lisa Galea: But as I find it out, then I can add it

729
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:10.330
Lisa Galea: I've written it down, it's the avatar.

730
00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:17.419
Lisa Galea: So, I go… so the answers I'm getting, that I've asked all the random shit I collected, which I'm going to show you how to do that.

731
00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:21.570
Lisa Galea: Then I'd actually name it when it comes over here, Avatar.

732
00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:25.420
Lisa Galea: So then on the next one, I'm like, okay, now I want to go and see the market.

733
00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:29.350
Lisa Galea: And because… then I grab them over, and I'm like, they're the market.

734
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:35.840
Lisa Galea: So I'm sort of moving through, and I can start selecting them, and saying, okay, what's trends? What's markets?

735
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:39.680
Lisa Galea: which is my avatar I want to work with, because I've named them properly.

736
00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:40.880
Lisa Galea: Can you see?

737
00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:41.420
Helena: Fun.

738
00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:43.929
Lisa Galea: And I've brought back the information from here.

739
00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:50.630
Lisa Galea: So, to add sources in here, it is magic, my friends. You can add YouTubes, you can add anything you want.

740
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:55.240
Lisa Galea: But you can go in here, and you can add Google Docs, no worries.

741
00:58:55.540 --> 00:59:03.160
Lisa Galea: It's… basically, you're using… like Gemini, or AI, but only on those documents.

742
00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:09.900
Lisa Galea: So you don't get shit. That's why it's great, and it's your documents, and then you can even come back to it and say.

743
00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:22.999
Lisa Galea: is there any information on this? Have I got any information on this? And it'll go and look for you. You can make, you know, so I would just go in here, but you can also, once… this is, like, now, you can search in here just the same as you would

744
00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:30.519
Lisa Galea: You can search or drive, do I have any documents about this? Or you can go to the web and say,

745
00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:34.119
Lisa Galea: We need to know about sterilization, blah blah blah.

746
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:36.849
Lisa Galea: If I put in sterilization here…

747
00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:49.110
Lisa Galea: I mean, obviously, you would type in something a bit more useful for them than that.

748
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:55.459
Lisa Galea: But it will go and just search for me, and then I can select what I want to add into here.

749
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:59.469
Lisa Galea: Which makes it a lot quicker than copying and pasting that you had to do.

750
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:03.060
Lisa Galea: But you see, you're like, oh, that's a lot of information.

751
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:04.930
Lisa Galea: Could be useful.

752
01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:10.380
Lisa Galea: I would have a little look, I'd hope you'd know. But then, now, we don't have to read it.

753
01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:19.439
Lisa Galea: Like, I don't like YouTube, I find it really hard to learn from YouTube. It just… I wouldn't watch someone do something. I need to see the list.

754
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:22.919
Lisa Galea: So I just get the YouTube link.

755
01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:29.740
Lisa Galea: Just chuck it straight in here, I just go add YouTube, then I'm like, write a comprehensive step-by-step on how to do this.

756
01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:36.080
Lisa Galea: And it just tells me what to do. So then I can watch the video, but I've still got it written there that I need to see in front of me.

757
01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:42.530
Lisa Galea: And the other amazing, amazing thing it does, like, say I just went here for my target.

758
01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.760
Lisa Galea: So I just would select my avatars.

759
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.170
Lisa Galea: And then I could go, give me a video overview.

760
01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:56.440
Lisa Galea: I could do a podcast. If I'm going to see, like, I, if I was going to see a new customer.

761
01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.390
Lisa Galea: I go in here, research them, bang it all in.

762
01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:04.059
Lisa Galea: And then I'm like, audio, I can just walk the dog and get a podcast and find out about them.

763
01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.630
Lisa Galea: So, it's pretty cool here.

764
01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:11.480
Lisa Galea: like, here… Straight away.

765
01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:22.169
Lisa Galea: Today, we're looking at a couple of source stacks that, might seem pretty disconnected at first glance. So, see, because I've put too much in there, but that's why I do the naming, okay?

766
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:29.369
Lisa Galea: big generational work profiles. It's pretty crazy. You can also do mind maps to find things out.

767
01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:33.500
Lisa Galea: So, with your data in there, it becomes…

768
01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.950
Lisa Galea: very useful. It does videos for you.

769
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:38.590
Helena: Okay.

770
01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:43.300
Lisa Galea: And even those podcasts, you can get out and use… you can change them into, like, your brand voice.

771
01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:50.380
Lisa Galea: So, it is… it seems… it's just very… if you're finding out information and you're researching competitors.

772
01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:52.660
Lisa Galea: Just bang them into a notebook.

773
01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:59.810
Lisa Galea: Because then, you can then just go and ask questions. What's the gaps? What are they doing? Do you see what I mean?

774
01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:04.899
Lisa Galea: And it just makes it way easier than you… and also, you can share, then, that research with me.

775
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.340
Lisa Galea: So, it makes it a lot easier to do.

776
01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:19.159
Lisa Galea: So, I highly recommend this one, because it's… it's in note… it's in Google's ecosystem, it's free, and…

777
01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:33.470
Lisa Galea: It's just, it is safe, and it's got all your stuff in there. So I'd highly recommend you play with that and make sure you start putting stuff in there, because you should be gathering a little bit too much information for your brain to deal with.

778
01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:47.309
Lisa Galea: that's really… it gets too much for you to do. So, highly, I just want to make sure that if you do gather any stuff, you can start putting links in there so you can ask questions and make better decisions, okay?

779
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:49.340
Helena: Okay, cool.

780
01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:57.510
Lisa Galea: Okay, and I will add you… I will just use… shall I use your Gmail or just your work ones to add you into my Notion page?

781
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:58.830
Helena: Work ones.

782
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:03.219
Lisa Galea: I'll just add you in here, and you will see… where's your portal?

783
01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.949
Lisa Galea: I've got, like, our moon sprint, and I'll just put any notes.

784
01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:13.589
Lisa Galea: And then we can just start, like, gathering what we're doing, because I still think this is just really easy.

785
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:15.140
Helena: Okay.

786
01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:19.239
Lisa Galea: Yeah, it's just so easy. Like, the project management thing is… it's messy.

787
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:30.620
Lisa Galea: Whereas this is, like, hopefully that, in the end, it's like, okay, we're here. This is database structured, so it's, like, basically Excel on steroids. So we can also export them out.

788
01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:34.020
Lisa Galea: As databases as well, so it's very useful.

789
01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:40.449
Lisa Galea: That is it. Have you got any questions? Because I think we've done good, and we can gather.

790
01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:50.650
Helena: I don't think so. The only thing I need to do is put all of our assets in that Google Drive, and then I'll send you our priority list of outcomes.

791
01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.750
Helena: And then I think that was it.

792
01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:54.550
Lisa Galea: And then…

793
01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:55.130
Helena: Right?

794
01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:58.399
Lisa Galea: What about, then, on Thursday.

795
01:03:59.090 --> 01:03:59.770
Helena: Or when to come.

796
01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:07.339
Lisa Galea: all the… I'll pull that… I… because I actually, just before the meeting, grabbed an old hard drive out.

797
01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.360
Lisa Galea: Because I did think, as well, having…

798
01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:15.660
Lisa Galea: the brand… I think we can make it look really good with the brand story, with the culture.

799
01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:24.880
Lisa Galea: And I've pretty much got the first brochure. I've got everything. I know I have, because that's what I had for HPB. So I started off when you were still… were you called Hauken?

800
01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:26.590
Helena: Yes.

801
01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:30.890
Lisa Galea: So I've got all… I'd have definitely all that documentation and everything from then.

802
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:32.170
Helena: Oh, perfect.

803
01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:39.769
Lisa Galea: And so, gathering those odd photos is this when we started. It gives that weight that we've been here this amount of time, and.

804
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:42.270
Helena: I mean, a bit of a timeline story and stuff.

805
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:50.029
Lisa Galea: want a story on it, so it was just like, it's a nice story that adds weight, as we are an established company, we didn't start last week.

806
01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.240
Helena: Yeah.

807
01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:51.770
Lisa Galea: And that.

808
01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:52.110
Helena: Yes.

809
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:59.030
Lisa Galea: these are the little beads, is how we build the trust. Because I think that that's what we're really aiming to get, is trust by the Tier 1s.

810
01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:00.140
Helena: Yes.

811
01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:05.239
Lisa Galea: They'd prefer to use a family, they'd prefer to someone who cares about it, they want better results.

812
01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.300
Helena: But they're just not sure that if they can trust you to handle the job.

813
01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:10.580
Helena: Yes.

814
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:11.480
Lisa Galea: Perfect.

815
01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:18.810
Lisa Galea: Alright, my friends, have the best day on purpose. What time on Thursday? Let me know. Suits you.

816
01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:21.009
Helena: Yeah, we'll have a bit of a look.

817
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:25.149
Lisa Galea: one, let me know, because I know, Isabel, if you want to just talk about that…

818
01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:27.970
Lisa Galea: You just told me when, that's fine.

819
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:30.340
Isabelle: Yep, yep, yep. Easy peasy.

820
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:34.759
Lisa Galea: And what about on… do you think Tuesday, Thursday?

821
01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:41.959
Lisa Galea: And do you have a time? Do we… should we do… Tuesday? I think this is a good time, end of that.

822
01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.500
Isabelle: Yeah. Next year.

823
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.460
Lisa Galea: Oh my gosh.

824
01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:49.620
Helena: Tuesday, we're at a conf… next Tuesday, Thursday, we're actually at a conference in Melbourne.

825
01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:54.389
Lisa Galea: What other days you have that week. Any other days, or not really?

826
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:57.750
Helena: We could do… Friday?

827
01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:00.090
Lisa Galea: Friday, okay.

828
01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.989
Helena: Friday, or super early Monday morning.

829
01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:10.870
Helena: Which could work your time, because our 8.30 is actually your 9.30.

830
01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:13.739
Lisa Galea: Not a pretend.

831
01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.209
Lisa Galea: But I will…

832
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:24.449
Lisa Galea: I was so glad that I had the extra hour, you won't believe. But I did work till very late, so that's fine. I,

833
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:30.329
Lisa Galea: Yeah, okay, well, I think Friday is a definite. You tell me what time you have on Friday.

834
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:36.650
Lisa Galea: And… we will see what we need. It might… we would still… we still can communicate.

835
01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:41.959
Lisa Galea: Yeah. But I do think, really, to get this done in quick enough.

836
01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:46.740
Helena: the two catch-ups a week. Yeah, yeah, it'll be… we definitely need those, but I also think…

837
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:49.629
Lisa Galea: My job is to do what I normally do for brand strategy.

838
01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:54.300
Lisa Galea: Do the research and do that stuff for you. So next week, if you're not gonna be here.

839
01:06:54.620 --> 01:07:00.970
Lisa Galea: I will still block those times in and make sure, okay, well, that means I can really get deep and know what's going on with this myself.

840
01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:06.640
Lisa Galea: And so then, we can build tools that are useful for them, and things that we know will…

841
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:11.799
Lisa Galea: You know, that'll… the best presents for your people, because that's why I like to know people very…

842
01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:15.360
Helena: Yes. Just so we can make them what they want, and everyone's happy, and…

843
01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.950
Lisa Galea: We'll do a good job.

844
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.080
Helena: Perfect.

845
01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:27.640
Lisa Galea: Excellent, I look forward. You tell me that priorities, I'll look at that, and then Thursday, we do… I think Thursday, ideally, if you could do, like, a 10-ish.

846
01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:33.629
Lisa Galea: like, more of a morning, because today we're really not going to do anything. We're going home, like, we might tidy up.

847
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:34.440
Lisa Galea: I mean.

848
01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:34.810
Helena: movie.

849
01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:37.000
Lisa Galea: good that on Thursday, if…

850
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.260
Helena: Following Thursday.

851
01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.870
Lisa Galea: Or notes, like, I'm saying every week for the next.

852
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:41.560
Helena: Oh, yeah.

853
01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:49.699
Lisa Galea: Apart from if you're busy, do you know what I mean? But if we had that meeting in the morning, it would mean, oh, I've had it at 10.30, shit, we have got stuff to do.

854
01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.390
Helena: Huge stuff to do.

855
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:53.970
Lisa Galea: Thursday afternoon to maybe pull my finger out.

856
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:59.330
Lisa Galea: Whereas if we leave it till Thursday afternoon, you know, it's Friday, and we're like, oh, who could be bothered?

857
01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.290
Helena: Yeah.

858
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:13.889
Lisa Galea: I'm like that. So it's like, if you do me… if we go in Thursday morning, where are we at? Have we done what we wanted this week? Shit, we haven't, highly likely. Then we go, shit, we better do it, and we at least have got half a day.

859
01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.179
Helena: To do… have… do something.

860
01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:17.529
Lisa Galea: Do you work on Fridays, normally?

861
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.129
Lisa Galea: Yeah, okay, cool. So you both were all days?

862
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.819
Lisa Galea: Okay.

863
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.810
Helena: Which makes it easy.

864
01:08:24.819 --> 01:08:26.439
Lisa Galea: Yeah, okay, cool, I don't… that's fine.

865
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:34.129
Lisa Galea: So I don't normally work Mondays, but I do work Fridays. I work till 12 on Fridays, but…

866
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.770
Helena: Okay.

867
01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:45.010
Lisa Galea: I'm flexible, because what am I really not doing? I'm already working on Fridays for years. I'm happy to do every one's fine. But I… it's good, because I keep Fridays for that, for clients, if they need me.

868
01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:45.890
Helena: Okay.

869
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:46.450
Lisa Galea: Bye.

870
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:49.870
Lisa Galea: My team now, I'm here till 12. It's more for my team, don't bother me.

871
01:08:50.109 --> 01:08:51.180
Lisa Galea: On Mondays.

872
01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:53.930
Helena: Perfect.

873
01:08:53.939 --> 01:09:02.099
Lisa Galea: Excellent. Let's get… I think we will achieve for this first two weeks, I really want to get you to the point where we've got that brand guide, because I think we will have all of that ready.

874
01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:05.640
Lisa Galea: And we know what assets we're missing.

875
01:09:06.029 --> 01:09:06.599
Helena: Yeah.

876
01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:15.139
Lisa Galea: But we just need to really get clear. We will definitely… I'm confident, at the end of this two weeks, we're like, cool, we actually look okay, we've got this.

877
01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:15.850
Helena: Oh my god.

878
01:09:15.939 --> 01:09:16.749
Lisa Galea: forwards,

879
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:20.560
Helena: Yes, perfect. No, that's great. Thanks so much, Luis.

880
01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:22.729
Lisa Galea: No worries, my friend, have.

881
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.500
Helena: Bye!

882
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.580
Lisa Galea: Yeah, bye.
