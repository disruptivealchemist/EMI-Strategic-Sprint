# Meeting Outcomes — Moon Sprint 1.2 (10 Oct 2025)

## Project Scope

**Scope Focus:**  
- Conference preparation (Melbourne, next week) and future Hong Kong event.
- Business strategy, branding, customer engagement, marketing tactics, competitor analysis, digital marketing, website design, brand consistency, customer personas, communication strategy, product differentiation, market research, distributor enablement, and case studies.
- Deliverables include: distributor books, conference materials, website/brand asset alignment, and digital footprint research.

**Out of Scope:**  
- Food giveaways for overseas conferences (uncertain regulations).
- Full website relaunch before conference (focus is on asset and messaging alignment, not rebuild).

## Stakeholders

- **Lisa Galea:** Project lead, strategy, behavioral science, brand/UX review, and sprint management.
- **Helena E:** Creative lead, asset creation, brand guide, and conference preparation.
- **Isabelle Em:** Industry/competitive insights, technical product knowledge, and distributor engagement.
- **Odette:** Digital asset production, website updates, and template creation (internal resource).
- **Other contributors:** Family stakeholders, external distributors, and conference contacts.

---

## Objectives

- Prepare for Melbourne conference (week of Oct 13) with distributor-focused materials and strategic networking plan.
- Build out a clear, consistent brand and digital presence (website, templates, business cards, case studies).
- Develop and document customer personas and key decision-makers for targeted outreach.
- Ensure all assets (brand guide, templates, case studies) are accessible and consistent.
- Begin groundwork for Hong Kong conference and US market expansion.
- Complete digital footprint research and competitor analysis.
- Align internal vision, mission, and values for clear communication and team buy-in.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Time:** Tight timeline for conference prep; only 4 weeks for asset creation, 2 weeks for templating.
- **Brand Consistency:** Current website and assets lack alignment (multiple fonts, inconsistent messaging).
- **Resource:** Odette requires clear, detailed direction and confidence-building; avoid overwhelming with creative ambiguity.
- **Market Perception:** "Made in Australia" is valued but perceived as expensive in US; messaging must emphasize compliance, quality, and technical superiority, not just origin.
- **Team Capacity:** Website relaunch and asset creation must be prioritized; avoid scope creep.
- **Gatekeepers:** Success at conference depends on connecting with key decision-makers and their teams, not just top-level contacts.
- **Internal Alignment:** Vision and purpose need to be clarified and communicated to all team members.

---

## Completed Tasks

- Brand guide uploaded to shared folder (Helena).
- Initial digital footprint scan: No negative mentions, clean online presence (Lisa).
- Competitor analysis and market research reports compiled (Lisa).
- Conference attendee and key contact research started (Isabelle, Helena).
- Asset audit: business cards, letterhead, and color palette reviewed.
- PowerPoint template draft initiated for internal use (Helena).
- Team added to Notion/portal for resource sharing and collaboration.

---

## Tasks Out of Scope / Adjusted

- Full website redesign deferred; focus on aligning current assets and messaging.
- Food giveaways for overseas events not planned due to regulatory uncertainty.
- No immediate push for new logo or major rebrand; emphasis on consistency and clarity.

---

## Dependencies & Next Steps

- **Conference Prep:** Finalize and print distributor books, business cards, and case studies for Melbourne event.
- **LinkedIn/Networking:** Identify and follow key conference attendees and decision-makers; prepare personalized outreach.
- **Brand Consistency:** Audit and update all digital and print assets for font, color, and messaging alignment.
- **Template Creation:** Complete PowerPoint and document templates for rapid deployment.
- **Persona Development:** Build out detailed customer and distributor personas for targeted communication.
- **Vision/Mission:** Workshop and finalize company vision and mission statements for internal and external use.
- **Case Studies:** Gather and format case studies that address customer pain points and demonstrate product differentiation.
- **Digital Footprint:** Continue monitoring for new mentions; supplement with manual and API-based searches as needed.

## Risks to Monitor

- Asset creation and approval delays could impact conference readiness.
- Inconsistent messaging or visual identity may undermine credibility with Tier 1 targets.
- Overloading internal resources (Odette) without clear direction may slow progress.
- Failure to connect with key gatekeepers at conference could limit ROI.

## Summary

The team is on track for Melbourne conference preparation, with a strong focus on distributor enablement, brand consistency, and strategic networking. Key risks are being managed through clear task allocation, resource support, and ongoing review of project scope and dependencies. Next steps include finalizing all conference materials, aligning digital assets, and deepening market and persona research to support both immediate and long-term expansion goals.
