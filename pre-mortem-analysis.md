# Pre-Mortem Analysis: 6-Week Branding and Marketing Sprint

## Introduction

This document conducts a "pre-mortem" analysis for the 6-week branding and marketing sprint. By imagining the project has failed, we can proactively identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies to increase the likelihood of success.

## Imagined Failure Scenario

It's six weeks from now, and the branding and marketing sprint has failed. The initial excitement has faded, and the team is left with a sense of frustration and disappointment. The R&D grant application was weak and unfocused. The new brand guidelines are not being used consistently. The expensive new marketing automation tool is a ghost town. What went wrong?

## Potential Causes of Failure

### 1. Lack of a Clear and Actionable Plan

*   **Cause:** The 6-week timeline was too ambitious, and the team tried to "boil the ocean." The project plan was a high-level overview, but it lacked a detailed breakdown of tasks, dependencies, and deadlines.
*   **Evidence from Transcripts:** The excitement around the project is palpable, but there is a danger of this enthusiasm leading to a lack of focus. The desire to do everything at once is a real risk.

### 2. Stakeholder Misalignment and Decision-Making Gridlock

*   **Cause:** The different priorities of the stakeholders (James's vision, Helena's creativity, and Isabelle's process-focus) were not effectively managed. This led to disagreements on key decisions, and the project stalled.
*   **Evidence from Transcripts:** The transcripts reveal distinct perspectives. While this is a strength, it can become a weakness if not managed. Isabelle's focus on "how it's going to work for everybody" could clash with Helena's desire for creative freedom if not properly mediated.

### 3. The "Shiny New Toy" Syndrome

*   **Cause:** The team became overly focused on the selection and implementation of new AI and marketing automation tools. The strategic work of defining the brand, target audience, and content plan was neglected. As a result, the new tools were never effectively used.
*   **Evidence from Transcripts:** There is a lot of excitement about AI and bots. This is a positive, but it needs to be channeled into a strategic implementation rather than a purely technical one.

### 4. Insufficient Resources and Expertise

*   **Cause:** The project assumed the availability of in-house expertise that did not exist. The team was stretched too thin, and they lacked the technical skills to implement the new systems effectively.
*   **Evidence from Transcripts:** James mentions "in-house capability," but the actual skillsets and availability of these resources are not clearly defined.

## Proactive Mitigation Strategies

To avoid these failure points, the following proactive steps are recommended:

*   **Develop a Detailed Project Plan:** Break down the 6-week sprint into weekly, and even daily, tasks. Assign clear ownership for each task and set realistic deadlines. Use a project management tool (like Notion, which was mentioned) to track progress.
*   **Establish a Clear Decision-Making Framework:** Define who has the final say on different aspects of the project. For example, Helena could be the decider for creative decisions, while Isabelle has the final say on process changes. James can act as the ultimate tie-breaker.
*   **Prioritize Strategy Over Tools:** The first 2-3 weeks of the sprint should be almost entirely focused on strategy. The brand guidelines, target audience definition, and content plan must be in place before any new tools are selected.
*   **Conduct a Skills Gap Analysis:** Honestly assess the team's current skills and identify any gaps. Plan for training or external support where needed. Don't assume that everyone can become an AI expert overnight.
*   **Schedule Weekly Check-ins and a Mid-Project Review:** A weekly meeting is essential to keep the project on track. A more formal review at the 3-week mark will provide an opportunity to assess progress, adjust the plan, and address any emerging challenges.
