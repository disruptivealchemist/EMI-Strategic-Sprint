## Project Coordination & Success Metrics

### Dual Project Management Strategy
**Concurrent Execution:** Projects run in parallel with shared resources and coordinated deliveries:
- **Project One** focuses on immediate needs and quick wins for current client opportunities
- **Project Two** builds comprehensive foundation for long-term growth and scalability
- **Shared Benefits:** P1 deliverables inform P2 strategy; P2 systems enhance P1 outputs

### Resource Coordination Schedule
**EMI Team Commitment:**
- **James Emery:** 4 hours/week (strategic direction across both projects)
- **Helena Emery:** 8-10 hours/week (intensive creative leadership, especially P1 Weeks 1-3)
- **Isabelle Emery:** 6 hours/week (operations, processes, and AI integration focus)

**External Team Structure:**
- **Success Sherpa (Kara):** Full coordination of both projects, ensuring no conflicts
- **Lisa Galea:** Strategic oversight and P2 development leadership
- **Rachel:** Documentation systems (primarily P2, supporting P1 as needed)
- **Helena's Design Team:** Brand and creative execution (intensive P1, strategic P2)

### Success Tracking & KPIs
**Project One Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Immediate client materials ready within 3 weeks
- ✅ Conference participation enabled by Week 4
- ✅ Distributor package operational by Week 6
- ✅ EMI team confident and equipped for current opportunities

**Project Two Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Comprehensive AI tool operational by Week 10
- ✅ Complete documentation system by Week 8
- ✅ Industry authority positioning established by Week 12
- ✅ Export market readiness by Week 16
- ✅ Full system integration and team autonomy by Week 18

### Risk Management & Coordination
**Key Risk Mitigation:**
- **Resource Conflicts:** Success Sherpa manages priorities and prevents overallocation
- **Scope Creep:** P1 maintains strict "immediate needs only" focus
- **Timeline Dependencies:** P1 completion not dependent on P2; P2 enhanced by P1 learnings
- **Stakeholder Bandwidth:** Buffer weeks accommodate EMI team availability constraints

---

## How to Use This Tracker

- **Weekly Reviews:** Update progress and identify any cross-project dependencies or conflicts
- **Sprint Planning:** Use buffer weeks for QA, stakeholder review, and priority adjustments
- **Resource Management:** Coordinate EMI team time allocation between projects to avoid burnout
- **Success Measurement:** Track both immediate wins (P1) and long-term foundation building (P2)

---

**Next Actions (Week of Jan 8-12, 2026):**
1. **Jan 9:** Confirm EMI team availability and project priorities
2. **Jan 10:** Finalize resource allocation and coordination protocols
3. **Jan 11:** Project setup and stakeholder alignment session
4. **Jan 12:** **PROJECT START** - Launch both P1-S1 and P2 preparation activities
