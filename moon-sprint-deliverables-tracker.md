## How to Use This Tracker

- At the end of each sprint, update the **Status** and move any incomplete deliverables into the next sprint’s buffer week.
- Use the buffer week for QA, stakeholder review, and to resolve any blockers.
- Review this tracker in each sprint planning meeting to ensure all deadlines are realistic and risks are managed.

---

**Tip:**  
Always aim to complete deliverables by the end of the sprint, using the buffer week only for true exceptions or unforeseen delays.
