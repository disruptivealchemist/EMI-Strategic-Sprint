The Royal Eye and Ear Hospital Case StudyPartnerAthertonINDUSTRYCSDLOCATIONEast Melbourne, VICProject Feature: Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital – CSSD FitoutAs part of the major redevelopment of the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital (Eye and Ear) in Melbourne, Emery Industries partnered with Atherton to deliver a specialist fitout for the hospital’s Central Sterile Services Department (CSSD).The Eye and Ear is Australia’s only specialist eye, ear, nose and throat (ENT) hospital, treating nearly 220,000 patients each year, including over 40,000 emergency presentations. It is the largest public provider of ophthalmology and ENT services in Victoria, delivering more than half of the state’s public eye surgeries.The redevelopment project upgraded both new and existing facilities, with eight operating rooms, expanded recovery spaces, and improved patient accommodation. Within this upgrade, the CSSD required custom-designed equipment to support the hospital’s critical sterilisation and infection control workflows.Emery Industries supplied and installed:* Height-adjustable sinks – ergonomically designed to reduce strain and support staff wellbeing during repetitive tasks.* Custom wrap stations – manufactured to precise clinical specifications, enabling efficient sterile packaging processes.* Packing benches – engineered in premium-grade stainless steel for durability, easy cleaning, and long-term performance in high-use settings.By combining custom manufacturing capability with infection control–ready stainless steel solutions, Emery Industries ensured that the CSSD fitout not only met the functional requirements of the redevelopment but also supported staff safety, workflow efficiency, and long-term resilience.This project demonstrates the value of Emery’s collaborative partnerships — in this case with Atherton — and our ability to deliver tailored, Australian-made equipment for some of the nation’s most specialised healthcare environments.The Wesley Hospitals CSSD Department Case StudyPartnerSESSINDUSTRYCSDLOCATIONAuchenflower, QLDProject Feature: The Wesley Hospital CSSD RedevelopmentProject Value: $14 millionCompletion: April 2024Client: Uniting Care HealthScope: Full CSSD Redevelopment and Compliance UpgradeEmery Industries is proud to have been selected as a key supplier for the major redevelopment of the Central Sterilising Services Department (CSSD) at The Wesley Hospital—now the largest private CSSD facility in Queensland.Delivered as part of a transformative $14 million redevelopment led by Icon Construction, this project significantly expanded the hospital’s sterilisation capabilities to support more than 25,000 surgical procedures annually, with the capacity to reprocess over 5 million instruments.

This project formed part of a critical infrastructure initiative to expand mortuary capacity in response to increasing demand, with a modular solution implemented until a permanent facility can be commissioned. Scope of Work: The project scope included scalable mortuary racking systems engineered to accommodate both standard and bariatric trays, full on-site installation, commissioning, and technical support. Application Summary: Emery's stainless steel racking systems were integrated into the cold room and freezer compartments to support a total of 267 tray spaces—211 in refrigerated conditions and 56 in freezer storage. Designs were tailored to be fully compatible with existing tray specifications while complying with WHS guidelines to minimise manual handling risk and optimise operational workflow. Why Stainless Steel Was Used & Its Benefits: Stainless steel was selected due to its superior corrosion resistance—essential in refrigerated, high-humidity environments—and its ease of cleaning, durability, and low maintenance requirements. A combination of 304 and 316 grade stainless steel was utilised across components to satisfy hygienic design criteria and structural load demands. These racking systems replaced an earlier concept that included powder-coated or painted mild steel, offering significantly improved longevity, safety, and lower lifecycle costs.  This project exemplifies engineering precision and healthcare-specific functionality. The mortuary racking was manufactured to tight tolerances to ensure compatibility with legacy trays, while introducing a modern modular design capable of adapting to future requirements. The systems—available in five-tier and three-tier configurations—support significant static loads (250kg–350kg per tray slot) and are designed to be reconfigured on-site within 24 hours, a capability rarely available in current mortuary infrastructure. Installation was completed in a live, operational forensic environment with zero disruption to critical services. Emery's project delivery included detailed documentation, hands-on staff familiarisation, and post-installation support that exceeded client expectations. This project sets a benchmark for excellence in technical delivery, operational impact, and adaptability in mortuary design.    Key innovations in this project included: * Scalable Rack Design: Modular racking frames designed to allow field adjustment between three, four, or five tiers, enabling rapid response to changing capacity requirements. * Quick-Reconfiguration Mechanism: A unique Emery-developed rapid-change tier system enables facility staff to adjust racking layouts within 24 hours, significantly enhancing surge-readiness and flexibility. * Infection-Control-Informed Fabrication: Fully enclosed stainless steel surfaces with internal weld protocols were implemented to eliminate bacteria-trapping crevices and promote optimal sanitation, aligned with mortuary-grade infection control standards. These innovations position Emery’s racking systems at the forefront of mortuary equipment design in Australia, addressing not only functional and operational challenges but also infection control and long-term maintainability.   Emery Industries delivered this project under a stringent quality framework, ensuring each unit met the highest standards for safety, strength, and reliability: * Welding Procedures: All structural welds were completed in accordance with AS/NZS 1554.6, using precision TIG welding for high finish quality. All welds were passivated post-fabrication to maintain corrosion resistance. * Testing & Certification: Static load testing was conducted on every rack tier to confirm capacity performance (250kg for standard, 350kg for bariatric), verified and certified by independent third-party inspectors. * ISO-Certified Quality Control: All production activities were governed by Emery’s ISO 9001:2015-certified Quality Management System, covering traceability, dimensional control, and procedural verification. * Client Support: Emery provided comprehensive technical documentation, visual guides, and on-site familiarisation. Commissioning included formal handover, warranty information, and proactive service support. With rigorous quality management and an emphasis on customer communication, Emery ensured a seamless and defect-free delivery that met all of Queensland Health’s critical performance requirements.   Sustainability was a foundational element in both material selection and manufacturing practices: * Sustainable Material Use: Stainless steel offers a significantly extended lifecycle, requires minimal maintenance, and is 100% recyclable—making it an environmentally superior option over painted steel or composite alternatives. * Certified Environmental Management: Emery’s manufacturing operations are governed by our ISO 14001-certified Environmental Management System, ensuring best-practice approaches to sustainability, emissions control, and waste minimisation. * Waste Reduction: All stainless steel offcuts and scrap materials were recycled via Emery’s closed-loop recycling program, reducing landfill and supporting material circularity. * Energy Efficiency: Our Gold Coast facility operates with energy-saving infrastructure including LED lighting, solar-assisted energy systems, and highly efficient CNC nesting to optimise material use and reduce operational energy demands. * Reduced Transport Emissions: As a Queensland-based manufacturer, Emery significantly reduced freight distances and emissions compared to imported products, supporting the local economy and minimising the project’s carbon footprint. This project not only delivered a high-performing technical solution but also upheld sustainability principles at every stage—from design to deployment. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Redevelopment Case StudyThe Queen Elizabeth Hospital (TQEH) redevelopment project, valued at $314 million, marks a significant advancement in emergency, critical care, and surgical services.
