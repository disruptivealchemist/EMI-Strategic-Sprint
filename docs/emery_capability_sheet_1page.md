# Emery Industries — Capability Snapshot

Target audience: Distribution Directors / Procurement Heads

What we are
- Emery Industries — Fully assembled, sterilisation‑optimised medical equipment manufactured in Australia.
- Primary value: minimise installation time, reduce infection risk and simplify project handovers for hospitals and facilities.

Key benefits (what matters to distributors & procurement)
- Faster deployment: factory‑assembled units reduce on‑site labour and commissioning work (see spec sheet for typical install workflow).
- Sterilisation optimised: engineered materials and workflows designed to meet sterilisation protocols and reduce rework.
- Lower TCO for customers: fewer site visits, predictable warranty & support packages, simplified logistics and spare part management.
- Australian manufacture: shorter lead times for APAC markets and reliable quality control.

What differentiates Emery
- Delivered ready‑to‑install (no flat pack): eliminates field assembly errors and reduces labour hours.
- Integration-first documentation: installation diagrams, BIM-ready assets and distributor playbook.
- Distributor enablement: one‑pager sell sheets, slide deck, sample scripts and margin + warranty terms.
