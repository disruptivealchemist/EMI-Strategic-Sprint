## 6. Deeper Analysis

### 6.1. Implicit Assumptions

*   **Resource Availability:** The project assumes that the internal team, including Helena and the contact in Melbourne, have the bandwidth and expertise to dedicate to this sprint.
*   **Seamless Collaboration:** It is assumed that all stakeholders will collaborate effectively, despite potentially different priorities and working styles.
*   **AI as a Panacea:** There is an underlying assumption that AI tools will be straightforward to implement and will deliver immediate value without significant configuration or training.
*   **R&D Grant Certainty:** The project plan assumes the R&D grant is a certainty, which may not be the case.

### 6.2. Potential Stakeholder Concerns

*   **James (The Visionary):**  Concerned with the ROI of the sprint and ensuring the project outcomes are substantial enough to justify the investment and to be framed as "R&D" for the grant.
*   **Helena (The Creative):**  May be concerned that new processes could stifle creativity and slow down execution. She is eager for tangible results and a "win."
*   **Isabelle (The Implementer):**  Concerned with the practicality and long-term sustainability of the new systems. She will want to ensure that the solutions are user-friendly and that the team will adopt them.

### 6.3. Technical or Resource Constraints

*   **Existing Tech Stack:** The project must work within the constraints of the existing tech stack (Odoo, Notion, etc.) or plan for migration.
*   **Technical Expertise:** The team's current level of expertise with AI and marketing automation tools is unknown and could be a bottleneck.
*   **Aggressive Timeline:** The 6-week timeline is a significant constraint that leaves little room for error or unforeseen challenges.
*   **Budget:** The reliance on an R&D grant suggests that the project has a limited budget.

### 6.4. Success Criteria to Clarify

*   **"A win":** What are the specific, measurable KPIs that will constitute a "win" for this project? (e.g., X% increase in leads, Y% reduction in time spent on a specific task).
*   **"Lowering risk":** How will the project measure the reduction of risk? (e.g., improved sales forecast accuracy, reduced customer churn).
*   **Brand Consistency:** What metrics will be used to track brand consistency? (e.g., a brand consistency score, a reduction in the use of old brand assets).
*   **Improved Experience:** How will improvements to the customer and employee experience be measured? (e.g., NPS, employee satisfaction scores, task completion times).
