Lisa Galea  00:00
Hello. Oh, your hair looks nice. God of hair. That's his name. Cut it. That's just how he's cut it. Oh, he just chops him. And you know what's fab, even if you get rained on, it looks like this, it's still fab. And that's why he's a god of hair, right? You're either a dickhead or you're the God of hair. Like, who calls himself Frankie got a hair, and I'm like, he's good. Mike's sister, when she came she's been wearing a wig because she's diabetic. And when you're diabetic, your hair doesn't grow properly. So she's old like, so her hair, she took her wig off, and I was the only other person who'd seen it, and it was like, pigtails, two tiny pigtails, like this. And she goes. I was on my way to see Frankie got a pair, and she's, like, I thought, because she's got no idea like shit. I thought you may be like, Could I see him? And I was like, Frankie mate, this is you need to be the God of her hero. I don't know what you do with this shit. It's like, no hair. When she walked out of the salon, it was like, Twiggy the model, I am not joking, and she's hit with the ugly stick. It's not normally a good look. This is the best I've ever seen her. And I was like, shocked. My chin dropped, and she was on the phone to her daughter in New Zealand, like, going and her daughter was just like, Oh my God. Like, that's the best I've ever seen you since you had long hair when you were a child. And I was like, she looked like more tissue when she was a child. She's got, like, mics, like she's got dad's chin, the dad's chin, you know? And it's like, it's okay on mic, but it's not good on a girl. Anyway. It doesn't matter. It's no matter her daughter's, her daughter's only like, Oh, she's She's lovely, she's an only child. She's nice. She'd be young, like, you like she really likes me. She hasn't got a sister, and I'm closer to her, but she'd be like 36 but she's only like 40 she's about four foot, tiny, yeah, and guess what? Uh, her partner is from UK. She met him there, and her Twitter profile said, Wait, wait for it. She shares this table when I'm like, they're just going right? She said. Her profile said, because she's married to him, as tall as I am, wide and I can feel my hand in my mouth, I it, and the baby can do it too. They've got two babies, so those huge mouths, right? And the mom and the mom, my sister, just goes, Oh, yeah, like, I don't know if you can do that. It's like a genetic thing, because the baby's just there with his whole hand in the daughter can just do it and soak in the mum. But who puts her on their profile? Like, that's weird. She's a ball, my friend, she's a hobbit.

Speaker 1  03:09
Oh, we're just saying. Lisa's niece put on a tender profile when she met her husband in the UK that she's as tall as she is wide and can fit her fist in her mouth. That was her profile.

Lisa Galea  03:27
And they were just giggling away. Thinking that was hysterical. They thought it was funny. They thought it was hysterical. What was funny was the wedding photos, my friend, because the husband is really tall, he's white, like really white. English person. Do you know what I mean? There's Whitey pasty people, and they went to Thailand or somewhere on the way home to New Zealand. And he's wearing linen shorts, Birkenstocks, a shirt and a red bow tie. And the only thing that suits him is a red bow tie. Basically, he should not be on a beach at any moment in time. And so it's really weird, like when you see the photo, she's fully dressed up in a thing, and then he's, like, This Englishman in a pair of shorts. That's bizarro, but whatever. But she's my she is a nice girl. She is a nice girl.

04:21
She means, well, she's just, well, she

Lisa Galea  04:24
does like they just don't taste and they, they're really kind to me because they, they appreciate my taste. So it's not like they don't, no, it's just they've got when I first met her, she had long socks on a brown sandals. And she was like, a teenager, like you guys. Was like, Do you know what I mean? And I was like, anyway, do you have a good weekend? Ladies? Yes. Mm. And how you feeling today. What's one word that describes how you're feeling?

Speaker 1  05:05
I'm feel good. I've been ticking off things, and this morning's been good, excellent.

Lisa Galea  05:11
How you feeling? Isabel, all

05:14
over the place today.

Lisa Galea  05:18
You've got lots of logistics to organize, I imagine,

Speaker 2  05:22
yeah, a lot of stuff, lot of stuff going on, lot of moving pieces at the moment.

Lisa Galea  05:27
What is your main priority at the moment? Because what date are you guys flying out?

Speaker 2  05:33
Friday, next Friday. So we leave a bit early. Have the weekend over there. Have a few sightseeing days on the weekend, and then we're do, we got two weeks into

Lisa Galea  05:42
it, two weeks we're on this Friday, and we got two weeks and we

05:47
So, Friday week. Yeah,

Lisa Galea  05:48
that's what my brand is. 27th in my brand, we had two weeks. And I was like, cool, we're under control. I did do stuff on the weekend, but I was like, two weeks just pumped out loads of shit. And that's what, that's why wallpapered. I wallpapered. I was, like, that was my property. No computers on the week on,

Speaker 2  06:07
I love that wallpaper. It looks so good done. I loved it.

Lisa Galea  06:11
Oh, my god. It's so cheap compared to anything. It's like, 140 bucks. Oh, really, like, compared to, like, you couldn't really put it. I don't think if it was an oven in front of it, but it said you couldn't varnish it. I put glass, I suppose, in front of it. I've done like one bathroom where I've just put like green leaves on it, and it's a shit bathroom, and basically it just distracts completely, yeah, and I just put like a piece of wood that I found in the it was actually one of those Hooters signs, you know, from early really. And I just basically sanded down the back so you couldn't see the Hooters. But it was actually a really nice shelf, and it had a little corner hole where it didn't match, so I could put the plug through there. Yeah. And it looks like, really cool. And that was like nothing, because it was just like a tiny wall. So definitely worth if you are looking to Yeah, and it wasn't. It was so easy. I was just like, water, fun, fun, fun. But my husband's gone away again yesterday. That was good. But let's look. Let's look where we're at. My friend, I was just looking. How do you go with the case study? Did you try any? I just remembered you just send me some. Did you try it? Maybe, maybe just drop them on Yes.

Speaker 1  07:36
Sorry. I wouldn't. I clicked on the link this. I mean, it come up with a 404 error. Let me get it for you then. So I haven't done the case.

Lisa Galea  07:49
I saw that. So I was like, I'll concentrate on them.

Speaker 1  07:51
Yeah. And then we had a catch up today for Hong Kong, and I think Odette will be emailing you at some point for the template for the pitch slideshow that we're going to have on the screen at Hong Kong. Yes, I think last time we spoke, you were doing it up for the UK as a template, and she was just going to make it Hong Kong direct. I've just swapped the words out.

Lisa Galea  08:17
Okay, the only thing is, because I've like, I've got it, like, for the UK one, I'd say most of it's like, I laid it out, but I haven't, like, completely finished, because we were like, Oh, we're not doing sending it, but it's in this it's in the teal for the surgical where it was, like, for really, I wanted her to see which I started. I did the brand positioning with the teal. But then I was like, she needs to see this in your Emery colors to understand that.

Speaker 1  08:47
I confirm that with her, because she started to make everything green,

Lisa Galea  08:51
yeah. And I was like, just make

Speaker 1  08:53
sure only for the case parts and transport trolleys. I said that was a color for

Lisa Galea  09:00
this that range? Yeah, perfect.

Speaker 2  09:03
Perfect. Is it the product line, or is it more our directed towards the UK, that color,

Lisa Galea  09:11
the color would be more for when we are directed to, no, it is part of your color scheme now that it is for when you're directing to say surge teams. So I would say that I would use it more broad, like keep it narrow for her now, but it would be more for your equipment that's going to be used in surgical because they like that surgical teal

09:37
equipment, the CST catalog

Lisa Galea  09:40
update, yeah, that would be, like, this real sterile stuff we

Speaker 2  09:44
could do, like the theater, theater stuff, like surgery,

Speaker 1  09:48
like, we wouldn't use it if we're doing the catalog for builders.

Lisa Galea  09:53
Yeah, that would be the blue and red, because actual stronger, right? And that we've also got them so we've got the. Before, you just had blue and red. And now you have your surgical steel, which is a surgical teal, which is the teal one. And you've also got this, the steel that steel gray, so with the builders and with the others, so that we don't have so much red as the contrast with the Navy, it would be more like shades of I've made, actually a clean Navy so that it doesn't go purple, because actually your logo goes lovely and purple with the teal, because it goes verbally, and it's like, oh, that's not okay. But, like it does, because it's got that purple underneath. So I've chosen a navy that when we she does shades of it, it is going to be actually Navy. And then she's also got the the cool gray, really, with the steel to represent the steel of the product. And so that will break it up. And really, the red should only be for calls to action, you know, like, I really want you to look at this. I don't want red everywhere, because it's like screaming, right? So again, I think I've also chosen a slightly cleaner red, like a darker red, because the red in the emery logo is also like fire engine red, which is great for the logo. And I've just chose like, a tone up so that we can just, just so that when it's on the page, it's not like, freak me, like, is a red button. So I've just been like, tweaking those, so that will look all nice. So I really think with the Hong Kong deck, um, what I'll do is I really try and make like, at least five designs. So there's, like, the cover page, you know, like a set of whatever they include in a normal PowerPoint template. I'll go check, you know, like, how they have a welcome page and another page just so she's got a set. Then she can actually, I'll make a few up, and then she can continue and finish it off.

Speaker 1  12:01
Yeah, because, like, she's just sent the whole company I've just put in the chat we put in our email footer if we're going to a conference, and she's just sent the little square that she would like us all to use.

Lisa Galea  12:18
That's what she said. That's why I think I'm social media tonight. That's what I was going to do when I get off from you. I'm going to do social media because I think she needs to see, like, how it transfers across.

Speaker 1  12:36
Yes, because we've, we've just seen the Atherton LinkedIn post. I've sent you that on text, I think, who are one of our local, local distributors, but also they are international. They've started posting that they're going over to Hong Kong, and have mentioned in their posts that we are going to be there. We haven't put anything up to say that we're going,

Lisa Galea  13:04
Yeah, well, I think that that's now we know we've got two weeks to go, so we really want to start dropping it, yeah. I mean, she's not even, like, we want to tie it in so people recognize the like, that's why they're giving you the brand assets, yeah. So you can say

Speaker 2  13:22
anything of the show. It's like, not even going, oh yeah. We're just going to this show. But if someone's not reading it, they're actually not going to realize the show, because the show has itself all its own branding that we can use.

Lisa Galea  13:33
And they've given us, I've already downloaded it, and it's in your hold up, because I was like, here's all the assets. So you've already got to put out straight away, because they've said, here's a post that says I'm coming to show and if I'm looking at that, I'm thinking, that's an ad. That's what that's selling. And that's the point. Is, when I look through your whole feed, you're just either top of funnel where it's like, Hi, we're Emery and this is what we do, or you're like, buy this, buy this, buy this. There's no middle where you're adding value. Like, this is what we know about stainless. And so we're helping you. Do you know what I mean? And that's what a lot of the others, that's that middle of funnel where they're like, Oh, I've got that problem. And that's what the case studies will be for. So we'll just break those up where, even if it's one little point that's like, this is a problem we solved, and that's like the title for the case study, and then you lead them to the website to read the proper thing that the caption. So I'm going to plan the next two weeks, because you show me some you liked. So we are set up for success. And I'm thinking of like the UK distributors watching you. I'm in my brain, right? Because they probably are

14:46
any American ones as well. Yeah. So

Lisa Galea  14:50
with the let's get that. Why have I shared? Yeah, can you see your screen? You see you? Okay, let's get that case study box. Because that I actually did. Think that because I was like, I started making case studies, and then I was like, obviously I've got to look at the text and think, do I like the text? I don't know, and it's not my text. And then it's like, kind of choose my own text. Why am I doing text copywriter? That's why I built these bots. That's why I'm so good at building word bots, because I can't do words. So luckily, our bots are good at that, but I did now, so I've put your three personas in there, and that is what I was just, I was just looking, I know that I've got so really, like, I'll grab the photo of them. So then, like, when I give this bot, really, so anyone can use it in the team, you've got quite how you would put a case study in there properly. And you would say, Oh, this is for strategic partners. This is for builders, right? So they know, because there's three different there's three different personas in there. Okay, so let's go into like, I've also put in there. I'm sure I did, because I was like, otherwise, that's why you work with me. So you get nudge tech, Stella steel, she has got a character. I didn't have time, yeah, did you like, did you see her picture? Did you see a picture?

16:26
No, no,

Lisa Galea  16:28
I know it won't upload. Like, I know. And I was actually Mike was like, meeting me in the car parks. Was leaving, and I was just like, I've got to go. I've got to go. What am I doing? But it's very cute. Where is it client? Sort because I just grabbed it out of the download. I just, I made it more blue. I made a bit bluey. She really should be a Russian blue, I thought. But, yeah, I thought she's the case study queen. She's the case study bot. And so I've got her little personality, and I'll do that thing, and I'll show you so that anyone could go in and say, Oh, I'm going to a builder, and you could chuck stuff in there, and she will go straight to again, you it's good. You guys have already had education. That's really good, because you understand what's going on. Because I don't know I'm actually doing, because these are actually markdown files I've created, which isn't a rag knowledge base, but for this, you don't really need it. It's fine, because we've got you just say, go to that document and it does. Yeah, I'm going to you. I've put these in a folder for you, so I think you can either add them into ODU as, like, I don't know if you can make the same sort of thing I'm imagining, you know, do, right? And what I'll also, that was the thing I wanted to do once we fine tune it is, I'll add some conversation starters, like I have with Nelly, where it would be, like, one page case study, right? So it would actually know that's what you want. Oh, a full case study, whatever. So she's it's got your market expansion plans for international and local so they know what your goals are. It's got, like, scarf model for behavioral science to, like, check, are we having status authority and making them happy? And so it's Sona one, the builder, the distributor, and then the in house person, and then this document is showing the correlation. Like this case study, these guys are interested in the same thing. So if there's a case study that covers both of them, really, it will go and look at this, right? But you would upload, and the last thing I would love to upload is, like, this is the format, right? Because when I went and started doing them, it, it gave study,

Speaker 2  18:54
it gave us an example, like format, it was thinks it should be,

Lisa Galea  18:58
well, that's what it knows, because it's, I go, like, training on how to do a case study. But obviously there's different you could say, actually we don't like those titles, yes, and because it did, gave me a couple of different ones, and I was like, Oh, God, it depends. Like, like, that is cool, but I don't know if that's how you and that's why I was like, You guys mess with the copy. And if she's got one, truly, she can make two documents, you know, like, I've given her a template. So it was like, That's a good one that she can actually do. Yes. So we got, yeah, that was your we've done the one, that one, haven't we? We've done that one. It's very annoying not being able to work on Adobe, off Google, driving me nuts. I have to work something out because I have to have two folders, clients. I. That is done. So that trolley, I will give her, and also do that in the other brand. Oh, I wanted to ask you before I did that. So that's like the normal color one we've got that. We've got it in the teal. I will do it so it's got the blue behind it, because I have to change the shadow. Did when I've done the full long one, yes, it, I had one where it had a draw, right? See, I'm taking. I'm taking because I've had to, like, AI that down, right? Yeah? And then I cleaned off the handles and stuff. Because I was like, Oh, I don't know if it's got a drawer or a door, like, I'll just get rid of it. So is that mine? Like that one

Speaker 2  20:50
would have a drawer, yeah? Usually that one would have a draw that

20:55
looks like it's got a long drawer. So that's fine.

Lisa Galea  20:58
That's fine, yeah? Because I thought it was like, okay, cool, as long as I just wanted to check it wasn't like, offensive or something, like we were that was, like, before I finished,

Speaker 1  21:06
I like it like that, with the stainless steel at the front and the teal at the back.

Lisa Galea  21:11
Yeah, I thought that because it made it was a bit annoying. When I put that in the yellow bucket, it became like, you know, like in the picture. I'm like, why am I even though it's blurred out, and it is in some cases, yeah, yeah. If it was in a safety compliance we'd be like, great. We want that bit of yellow for safety, yeah. But when I was doing it in the nice one, I was like, as a cover, I don't want to be yellow blob. It's ruining my brand. And I thought that. So you can have the option of then just basically, like masking out the front and then just doing the background. So I think that's better, especially with your stainless stuff.

Speaker 1  21:51
And we can use, we've got those great photos, we've got of the sinks. It would be really good to have the sink in silver, popping out, but the background to be the teal color.

Lisa Galea  22:02
Do you mean the ones for the case study?

Speaker 1  22:05
I think so, yeah, I have already,

Lisa Galea  22:08
I do think, yeah, I think it'd be good to put them in a duo tone the background. They are more they because they're sort of like they are perspective, but you don't mean they're weird legs I might like, it's like, you want them to really look at the front. And I feel like I want to cut the legs off to get close enough so that, yeah, they would look good. We really want that to pop out. I think it will look really nice, too, on the Navy when I tested

Speaker 1  22:36
it. And that's something that Odette would be able to do. Like, I'm assuming she should be able to edit an image.

Lisa Galea  22:41
Yeah, basically I've given and I will give her this like mock ups. I'm giving her the mock up so all she goes, export her a four, and she goes and changes the cover. So, like, out of it, whenever she does a new, like, case study, it will be, like, export the a four, go put it in the page so that we have those mock ups for her. Like this will be there waiting so it will be like, because it just looks so much better than and I think I saw one with the mock up already. That is I'm going to write a like standard for her. So be like. Every time you make their brochure, make these three mock ups, so you guys have them as, like, your standard set. So then anyone could be like, Oh, here's our brochure. You're like, this one as well. I'm going to try at the moment. That's cool. Yeah, I'd

Speaker 2  23:29
love to actually do that on our stainless

Speaker 1  23:33
we've we've tried. We've done so at least we're doing it R and D trials at the moment, because we want to get the E symbol to be backlit on our sinks, because we currently have no branding except for a sticker on our sinks. So the boys have figured out that they can laser cut and put a LED behind it with a perspex front, and it still be compliant. But they can't do the Emery. In fact, they can't do the letters because it makes too many sharp corners, yeah. But for the actual e thing, they can just cut it out and put like a perspex fill in front of it or behind it. Yeah, that's cool. Well, we're only early stages of that.

Lisa Galea  24:19
Well, I at the moment I made that background, and, like with AI, I still think it has a bit too many lines on it,

Speaker 1  24:27
but it was better. But it's very It looks like it needs to be finished. Yeah, that's

Lisa Galea  24:32
what it looks like. It needs to polish. Yeah. And if actually, that's what I realized like. Now I've done the front of that flat bit for that other catalog, sort of extending out real stuff that you had a good photo of. I was like, oh, that's how I'm going to get a proper piece that I've always wanted, like, by just keep extending out real stainless steel. Like, instead of trying it, because it's just doesn't seem to exist anywhere, they always make it scratch. Be. But at the moment, I'm up to like I've done. It's not the right color. Can you see the emery is not matching the back, so I want to make sure they're one still. So then once they are one, we can just change that to any color we wanted. So we'll just be printed like we were on till and we just wanted it. Because we really want to just keep like you're saying, you want that logo to be like Nike that, oh, there's Emery again, there's Emery again, there's Emery again, that they in the end, they don't think about it. And I thought this was quite a nice, subtle way to have it in corners or have it somewhere, because it's still not like, it's still there, but it's still, it's not blasting out, but it's,

Speaker 1  25:41
I just sent in the chat the etched Emery logo that the boys were doing in the testing.

Lisa Galea  25:51
Oh, I've seen that. I've got the she gave me the thingy. Didn't have a guide on it. She gave a logo guide on it. Well, that looks good. It's big,

Speaker 1  26:00
but that's like, what real the real steel looks like. I don't know if you could use that. You

Lisa Galea  26:06
see, it doesn't really, oh, look. See how horrible colors is because it picks up every reflection.

Speaker 1  26:12
Yeah, super hard to photograph. It's super

Lisa Galea  26:16
hard. But we have only got from those photos that you had, like, from when you were in the hospital, there's patches, there's patches. I saw them, and I was like, oh, there's definitely patches there. I can do that. Because what I'll probably do is patch and then overlay it on one that existed, yeah, just keep overlaying it till it looks like it's been polished. Because when they because I think when it goes shiny, then it looks like Chrome. So that sort of thing is like, well, so So she's got that where she's got the space for the quote that's relating to the book. So if, like, this is the product, and we have this mock up, so then you can use it for social media. That is my goal. So that's right. And then she's got the and this was our just our styles gave as we're going along. I think that's already open. Oh, and I think see how we like these are our shapes. I think that's good for

Speaker 1  27:18
that was the problem easily says, I'm a bit concerned, because I know that you've already given her this stuff. Yeah,

Lisa Galea  27:24
no, that's why I have to give it to her. See, these are the posts I'm starting to make. And that's when I thought, oh my gosh, she's gonna make everything to them. She's also gonna make, no, she can't. It'll be the exact I don't think she can make it. We need to show her that this is like it would, it would be more gray than like teal. Do you know what I mean? That's what I wanted to see. Is like, there should be very like it shouldn't be every single one's teal, because that that will be freaky, and you'll change your whole brand and like that will lose trust when you've got a good brand. There is zero need for you guys to change brand. It's just about tidying it up.

28:15
Yeah, more cohesive,

Lisa Galea  28:19
that's all. So I'm thinking we're more like this sort of thing is down here, and like we're, you know, that needs to be in navy, doesn't it? Like we have to have that in there, but see how that's that purple navy. That's why. Yeah, that's why. But we've also so one thing as well I'll be showing her, is making sure she uses shades, because when she drops that down, she will

Speaker 1  28:47
everything is square at the moment, everything is Yeah, fine, or square,

Lisa Galea  28:52
yeah. Also, the shades of the color she's doing she's not doing any, like, where's my color guide? Like that. Like, this should only be one. Like, if you think of like, your full strength brand colors are capital letters, so that's rude, and you're shouting. It's like, I'm on a page and it's going shout, shout. So we're trying to keep it like, mellow, and only shout when we actually want them to pay attention a bit more kinder. Yeah. So I want her to see, see how that pale you're like, it might be. That's why I needed to do it. I was like, Oh no, she can't do that, because that's going to just take a little bit of work. I'm going to look at your I use your posts, and that's was like, normally I just repeat customers post,

Speaker 1  29:43
yeah, repeat what we've already put on there. Just get

Lisa Galea  29:46
our new look. But that, that's what I'll do. But I also don't want to do that when you need posts, so I'm gonna try and make sure that they're like, Oh, you. That's why I was like, if you look at the words when I'm when I'm making them, I can't be thinking of words. That's why I just copy on top. But you, if you've given me new words, at least we can see how they work, like with quotes. And we just want to make sure that we really keep it on brand, because I don't want it to be changed, because it will break trust, because I think you've been going for a long time,

Speaker 1  30:19
yeah, yeah. But I think it will know our red and blue, yeah,

Lisa Galea  30:24
and that, remember, we'll put our photos in there. So it'll be, it won't be like, solid gradients like that, because we are more so that will be the persona like overview. So be like, this is the guide of, if you just wanted to have a quick look on all of them, right? And then we've got, like, the individual ones, which I will see. I'm going to make sure this one is done, the documents are all done, because obviously I've put them into the bot. But I was like, make the call, as long as you've got the overview with a one pager

Speaker 2  31:00
for each Yeah, that'll at least get her going. That will

Lisa Galea  31:04
get her going. And you'll have Ryan like this, and if she wants to, the copies there, if she sits around and paste it all in, right? Yeah, but it's all there if she wants to. And so, but I really no, so I'll give her I'm just adding, as you'll see. Let me show you where I'm adding that so it makes sense for you. Notion, notion, notion I have I'm adding here. This is all what I've added so far to your folder of the stuff I've got, like, all those image gradients, they're just, like, in the folder. So she clicks there, which they're assuming, and then working one, so she can take them into Photoshop and just bang them in, and then they're the ones I've made so far in the teal for this job. So, like, I've just chucked them in there as assets. So they're going to be, they're just all listed in the database, yeah?

Speaker 1  32:08
And they will add in the one with the silver with the steel at the front,

Lisa Galea  32:12
yeah, yeah. That was more of a because I wanted to have, like, a brand image as well. That was the other thing. What is your best selling cart? Like, I've found that one with the sticker, the sink is the best one. So if we wanted a product that was related, the product would be the sinks. Would it

Speaker 2  32:32
the our best selling products are our sinks and our transport trolleys would be our next line transport trolleys, or case

Lisa Galea  32:41
cards, the ones we've just done, because I just want to make sure, so they're like, oh, there's those trolleys again. We want to make sure that they're the things that you're showing. And I've got them as stand out brand pictures with the green done and everything, so we know, yeah, like

Speaker 1  32:59
people usually call us, oh, you're the guys that do the emery sinks.

Speaker 2  33:03
Okay, cool. It's our SP, 540, sync, which is our double rectangular bowl sink. Is our most popular product. We sell five product lines. SP, 540, perfect,

Lisa Galea  33:19
because that will be good. Then if we've got that, even if it's in the main image, or something just it's like, we want that, if they've got that association, and you want to sell more things,

33:29
even those images, that image from that one that has an

Speaker 1  33:35
example of a round ball and a square ball, like, if that, if the whole single pack was popped out, if we send the steel in the back, was in the gradient, that would look really nice.

Lisa Galea  33:47
Yeah, and maybe, do they do get that actually? Do you know what? Also, because I've also on my one for web, I took away those. I was like, come on, you can't have plugs, even if you like, you can have them. But that's just mess.

Speaker 1  34:00
It is mess. But I think that's also one of our height adjustable tables.

Lisa Galea  34:05
Yeah, no, I just did. I just got rid of them and blurred it out. I didn't get rid of the tables. You know what I mean? I was just like, I'm looking at that instead of the table. Sort of blurred it out. No one will know it's there. But I'm wondering as well, because we really want that. Emery, yeah, like, that's the thing with that's why I like the fun that drawer was like, Oh, it's right there, your sticker. So do we want

Speaker 1  34:29
apparel stickers that we use have the not they have the craft of a can logo on it, yeah?

Lisa Galea  34:36
But remember, I just put my sticker on it. I actually did change your logo.

Speaker 1  34:44
Yes, because we wanted it. We wanted the single bit stand out.

Lisa Galea  34:48
Yeah, well, all I did, I didn't do any major and I've made it like the same shape, but what I've done is made it so that the. Where is it elements? And she's got this, and you can put elements like, you've got everything in there. In your brand guide, it's so easy to use. Got all this, yeah, and I'll make, so I think I'm going to do like color theme and actually make like, this is all for stainless. So it's like, obvious they're not, like, it's named, this is just for that one. So it's not just color themes, you know. I mean, she's not got that confusion. Like, if anyone comes, they can see what they are. And all I did was just reduce that gap, just so that when we did that, it didn't look funny. It looks sort of weird. It was like there's a gap. So now we can do this, and we can have this, and I've also got that with the white behind it, so that it will so that will be a logo that you could just grab, and it's already got the white on it. Bang it on. Do you know, wherever you need, yeah,

36:01
the white with the round corner, yeah,

Lisa Galea  36:03
just with the tiny, like, it's got point two point corners on it, just to just soften them off, so that it's just a little bit of stuff. Yeah, so my design, I mean, she's like, chuck them all. So really, like, this would be, I mean, she's not still copy and paste, which is what I don't do. So I will finish this off. So it's like you can see them, because that's the thing I like this from a, you know, designer sort of view. But it's, I think we need to give her templates, because she'll start making you look barehouse. Yes, that's what I'm feeling it's like, well, yeah, but you know, like they've got to overlap. There's only certain ways we can use this, and what's missing is the space. That's what she's missing on all the pages. So keep that in mind when you're looking at stuff. So I'm not going to do a normal brand guide that like she's done, because, again, I pretty sense she can do those. But I am going to do this is, which is what I would normally do, you know? I mean, just give you the overview, yeah. So there's, I mean, she's got all the details. It's all written down, but I'm not going to go. I will just do that so we know, but I will put teal surgical the covers, and then I'll be like, here's another like cover. So you know, don't confuse us, please.

37:31
And yeah, we always need to show her something in the

Lisa Galea  37:36
not teal. That's why I'm gonna do that's why I thought the so the socials, and also I think the deck, yes, I think the deck, because otherwise you're just gonna have, even though I've done the stuff like I've half, I would say it's like 60% there the other deck for UK, but she could take over that once I show what the deck should look like for Hong Kong. You know what I mean? Said I do that, I was like, Don't worry about finishing that off, because, like, you gotta choose time do. So she's actually useful. I'm just trying to give you stuff that is actually long term useful. And I definitely think she won't cope with, you know, she won't cope with all that. Because even me, I'm like, where's the white, where's the gray, where's the shades? There's still no shades. Like, there shouldn't be a solid. There shouldn't be solid of that. Anyway, it like that. I mean, at the back, that's how that should be. So I'll go and do that, but I'm always grateful I don't copy and paste and I do like it, and we've got lots of shapes and possibilities. I also saw there's so much in here. I don't understand why she's not using Adobe, but I'm going to make your templates in here. Because I looked when I was just sitting, I was looking for me and you. Because I think that you know how the middle funnel contents, like information would be like, isn't it? It's like, those sort of things, right? How

Speaker 1  39:10
do they do the carousel thing on LinkedIn? It's

Lisa Galea  39:13
just PDF, right?

Speaker 1  39:16
Okay, if I teach you how to do that, that could be really good at getting

Lisa Galea  39:20
well, that's what I'm like for social media. If I can do a carousel, an infographic, yeah, so she's got some like, this is how it would work. I was smart in your colors yet. Do you know what I mean, but it's mostly white and just touches of the colors, like I'd have gray for that I definitely had because I was just saving when I was like, going there to bed. But almost 10 hours ago, it's probably not that long ago since I've been working on my stuff too. I got five brands to bring together in. One girl. I know it's a lot, so I've see how I've got the one pick brands for you, yeah. So she'll be there. We there. I really just think, I think you guys, your people like grids. They like that sort of thing. I'll show you there's, it's really easy with the infographics, because there's loads of get on one that's actually just there. If I go to templates, because you have access to this, don't you,

40:28
you have should do, but I've never used

Lisa Galea  40:30
your dad's got a full suite, right? He's got the full suite, and that means you have two people log in, right?

Speaker 1  40:37
So yeah, but I went to log in on it on the InDesign the other day, and she had her personal Mac logged in and her work,

Lisa Galea  40:45
yeah, so you kick her off because she can't be on two people message me all the time, and they're like, are you on space or Darlie? And I'm like, Dali, because it pisses me off. If they keep me off the wrong one, right? You get you off

Speaker 1  40:55
her personal Mac, because I know she's doing external work when she's supposed to be working

Lisa Galea  41:01
for us. Yeah, you don't get you she doesn't get have two max at once. Which one do you want me to kick off? Because I'm using the account, because

41:10
I just used to, I picked off their personal one.

Lisa Galea  41:13
But in here is, like, you see all these photos, so they're like, just there for free, or this stock. So like you grabbing stuff really quickly is easy. And also, when I went in, like, if you went in here to templates, I looked quickly on infographics last night. One, I mean, that's also your profile, have you, I don't know, your mom,

Speaker 1  41:37
our our LinkedIn, social banner. The only thing you can actually see is our logo, you

Lisa Galea  41:45
know, I'll have a look. So that needs to be updated. Yeah, I'm going to look. That's what I thought the social. And I'm going to do the social first, because then I'm like, we need to get that done tomorrow sort of thing. Yeah, and then the deck I really got, like, it's pretty much all the words, yeah, okay, now, what else do we need? So I'm just making sure

Speaker 1  42:10
you this, and then it is the website front page. Is that even done?

Lisa Galea  42:16
I mean, that's what I was just gonna go and check because, well, I did sort of have a little like, Oh my God. Like, it's like, we need to redesign. But see this how we've got our curve again, oh yeah, change it into our colors. Yeah, we just change it into your colors. So it's, there's quite a few that I've done like that, with that curve shape, and even this, that's your color again, you see what I mean. So it could be like, This is our surgical family, right? So they're really, like, there's so many templates, and once you've got a few, you just go start a new one, and your template is there, so you just use it, because that's really what you would have, is, I'm at the show, and you could just jump that on top of it, right? So we just want to find a few which I know I've saved in one file. I think your people, they like data. Yes, they like numbers. They like all that. This has also got great timelines, but even that concept map see how that's our shape. Yeah, I trust you girls. I trust you more than her, Yes, right? But I'm just saying, so you can see there's loads of good stuff in here that you could be using. And I'll just try, and I just want to try and lock her down for a bit, like, like, this one, I thought was like, 1234, that's what we do, you know, like, and we put it in your colors so we can that would be useful, I think, for you to have that sort of stuff. And I think that that's what they want. Like they want stuff that like is useful that you're helping them with. You know what? I mean? I haven't had time to ask for AI what they want, right? Let's look at your website next. So I have got case study you. Let me just get you that box. We didn't do it. I've just got to write what I've got to do. You can still use this case study, because I'm not going to do the fine tuning until I get feedback from you. Because if, when I we didn't, we're jumping all over the place. I'm only going to take 15 more minutes of your time. Let me go. I've done the other one. This Joan one was the first one I did. I'm sometimes like, where are you? Joan, she was very much like, it said, the gain, the gamble. And I was like, I don't know if they. Want to say that, but how down to earth do you think you would speak to these people? Because we did get when I was looking at the like,

45:13
pretty, I would say, pretty down to earth. Pretty down, like,

Lisa Galea  45:17
almost Australian, over, down, yeah, that's when I started thinking. I was like, would you know that?

Speaker 2  45:25
I think it's very conversational. It's not just like, here are the facts. It's like, Here, here's a conversation. There's nothing you're learning from me. I'm learning from you, because I need to know what your requirements are, and it's always different on different places. So it's very like, more consultation,

Lisa Galea  45:43
yes, so yeah, looks like I'm leaving them that's is a bit normally I wouldn't even let you see any much easier than trying to share

Speaker 1  46:05
it, because I'm going to assume that Odette hasn't started on any of the case studies.

Lisa Galea  46:12
Well, I'm assuming that too, even though I was like, Well, you could start one online. But she was like, I'm waiting for the

Speaker 2  46:26
only thing I know she's done that case study is that booklet that mom and her put together. Yeah, and

Lisa Galea  46:32
that's what I'm using, right? Because I'm using this right? So here's the one that I looked at. So say I did the second one. But then I was like, we need to just it was good. So it's summary for busy readers at the top. So it's really like your four pager and then like your one pager, and then the story line was the goal of why we were doing it, the gap. So that was the problem, the generic, the workflow, the gamble was back a direct partnership model. So you partnered directly with Waterloo healthcare to configure three cart lines tuned to each zone, D respects the gain faster ID. So see, that's those four things. And I was like,

47:22
I do like the four sections. I like the four

Lisa Galea  47:25
sections. But I also was dodgy on the word gamble. So I will, I know that's what I was like, it gives you, it breaks trust. It's not a word that we would have in that conversation. It's like, gambling makes me nervous. If I'm not a gambler, I don't think your people are gambling. You don't have good odds. Yeah, do you know what I mean? I'm like, we're not gambling here. We're certain that it's good, like, we designed for certainty. So we don't want to be gambling. So I think we'll just look what the I might go and just have a look. I don't need to ask, and I'm going to look what they others. I think normally they have, like, the impact, the mission. I just go keep it pretty standard ish, but I do like it. I like it if they're all it's nice when they've got that reiteration, yeah. And I think it is easier. And then we just put some photos through it, right? And so if we get one where I could say, Yes, I suppose I'll get one. I'll show you the framework, and if you're happy with it, I'll say, Hey, here's a template. Because once it knows that template, we want it to do every single time those four things not keep changing it. I think at the moment, because it's trained on how to do case studies, it hasn't got that specific we always want it like this, but it has got your people. Do you know what I mean? So I want to tune that up and then make sure we have those words triggers to just set it off, so it's easy for someone to use. So I need to just get those new titles for that, and I can actually finish it without you. And then you guys can just make case studies, and she can photos. Um, we have then got, we've done that website is that the last one website, it's useful type in website. It's just, when I was looking, I was like, oh my god, it needs to be readers line. There's just so much within like, we don't have time. I know. Do you know what I mean? I'm like, wait, we stop. I think

Speaker 1  49:33
I'm, I think I could get rid of that revolving image there, yeah, and just have Band Aid fix, just a static, edited image, maybe that image of the sink, like that image there, but with the greened out background.

Lisa Galea  49:53
Well, I'm gonna look because I think it shouldn't be the greened out background. Do you see what I mean? Let me look different color background. Yeah. Yeah, I will make it's either sinks or case studies, case cuts, whatever. So it's like, your thing, but I really like, it's almost like, I think I could almost make it into a triple photo, yeah, because it would be almost like, I feel you could fit another photo here. Do you know what I mean? We're not getting that. It'd be good to have a zoom in on a thing, like a zoom in someone, the lady pushing a cart, like, so you can actually, it's not just a cart. But I do like that, that we really pop the stainless, I think. So we do like, a third over here. So, like, we need one image made, and we get off this, I'm gonna, I think we should shorten these. Should just be products, yeah, products, yeah. So, products, departments, distributors, okay, because

Speaker 2  50:52
I think you look better with it being bolded. Because I'm saying, oh, bold and all those words are like, Yeah, on my eyes. Like, it's like,

Lisa Galea  50:59
too many words. And like, which one and

Speaker 1  51:03
Lisa, if you scroll down a little bit, not this bit, keep going down this bit here, it's doubled hospitals,

Lisa Galea  51:12
because I'll fix that. But you know why that's meant to be hidden, because I think what I was going to do, we I wasn't going to change this, but we will. I like that they're on there. That's I do

Speaker 1  51:24
like that they're on there, but I would to have more oomph with our international guys. We also need to have, like, trusted by these distributors, because people like,

Lisa Galea  51:33
continue, okay, can you tell me, then they're all down the bottom. Okay, cool. I got you them, all those guys. Do you want them up the top?

Speaker 1  51:44
Yes, because they actually give more Omn for than the government, than the government

Lisa Galea  51:49
bodies. Yeah, okay, so more don't I might not put these in. I'll put those and put the government lower down. Government down the bottom. I'll put this trusted by hospitalized, by industry, industry. That's when the government should be there, right? And what I was planning, because she put this photo in of you guys, I was planning here on putting the till with this big on top of it. Do you see what I mean? Okay, yeah, yeah. So you not got this thing. This would be more like, come meet Emery on the about page, like lead or somewhere, but this, that's why I did this. And I was like, run out of time. I think that should be the big banner, because I go and make the banner, but that would bring the teal down. And we'll be talking about that there. Do you know what I mean? Go and look at these products, but it will bring it in, but at the top, I don't think, I don't want to. We really want to keep that strong.

Speaker 1  52:46
Yeah, is that is the front of those, not right, squished.

Lisa Galea  52:51
It's too bold. I feel like it's a I'm looking thinking it's like a 900 font, and I think it should be a Sunday. And sort that out. So that's easy.

Speaker 1  53:05
And then I don't think our first call out on the front page of the website needs to be short lead time products.

Lisa Galea  53:12
No, that's what I wondered is like, is that? Where do you want that

Speaker 2  53:19
we don't have a lot of time for shortly. We're booked. We're booked until February

Lisa Galea  53:23
now. So basically, don't even have it.

Speaker 2  53:28
Don't even have it. Get rid of mentioning shortly time products. We can't fit them in at the moment, so there's no point advertising that we can do it, because I can't

Lisa Galea  53:36
see what we would really have is we're thinking, okay, they come here. They're they've missed that menu. I wonder if you can make it so the menu is fixed. She

53:47
needs to fix that menu so doesn't click it across

Lisa Galea  53:51
well, so it just stays at the top. At the top, so it's not like, where's my titles gone again. So fixed menu at the top. I've still, I only let her do I said to last week, only do half a day, because normally she won't split it, but she would split for me. And I was like, Look, I'm not ready for you, but we want some shit done, because we were going to UK, right? But I was like, save me half a day. And I said, like, if you can do half a day this week, and if I make those, because I've got to make the banner and make it, then I can just give it to her and she'll work out how to do that. Do you see what I mean? I was like, I can't do it, but I don't even use the theme, right? So fix menu at the top we want so that they can see that we'd really say, I put the contact here, because we got to think what we want them to do on this page. We basically want them to contact you or they go off so the distributor, who you're really going to be seeing, aren't you? Yeah, it's like here, we really want something that says, Are you a distributor? And then sends them to this do?

Speaker 1  55:00
Do we even need? I'm thinking like our distributors, know it sounds awful, but our distributors won't come to our website unless they just come straight to us. Yeah, so we need to tell people that we do for brand trust, so we do distribute through the best in the world, but I don't think the website needs to be tailored for distributed distributors, because they're going to have their own portal eventually, which means they won't even

Lisa Galea  55:29
come to the that's what happens with new rust. It's like, I ended up, it's annoying. We say can't sell to them because they never, ever come to the top end. They only go in the portal. I had to, and I did that for HPP as well. They had the same problem. We had to start putting ads through the back end portal, because they never see any blogs or anything. They never came to the front end to see what was going on.

Speaker 1  55:50
Our distributors are probably the most active group between our three target audiences on LinkedIn,

Lisa Galea  55:59
but they're when they come that, then when you're also, when you're putting stuff on LinkedIn, they see it, you're saying, Yeah, but we'd really want in, in the back end, you have, you got a new section, we're good. Because I think, like, they would have, like, with new us, we had the same thing. It's like, we're selling the new US. Front end is really selling the product. But we don't sell anyone front end. We're saying to distributors, so when they're in the portal, their news and their products, like selling tools. Like, did you know this? You could tell your clients you don't really put on the front end? No, we don't want that on the front end. So you have to have like, its own like, that's how you're selling to them, and that's where you're giving them tools so they can sell. So I would definitely think you would put that in the back end. Yeah, I'm nervous. I think you need to be. I think someone needs to think about the system with what you're doing here in terms of the whole design. And that's why I was like, Yeah, we, let's try not to waste money,

Speaker 1  57:05
because I think we can leave that form as it is, because it really

Lisa Galea  57:09
does nothing, right, like, it's basically a form. I mean, you could say it's a form.

Speaker 1  57:13
There's no, like, there's no distributors in Australia who do not know who we are, or we do not have their

Lisa Galea  57:20
What about this conference? I'm only thinking you're at Hong Kong. Are they not coming to your website?

Speaker 1  57:27
Then Hong Kong might only because we will QR code them to the front page of the website, right?

Lisa Galea  57:38
So that's what you've got to think. Where are you QR coding them to what that page for? No, there's nothing on there. There's nothing to tell them on that homepage that's useful. You'll be better off sending them here where they can go, oh, there's, I build trust because you've actually got case studies and things about,

Speaker 1  58:00
yeah, that's actually a good idea as well, to the QR code for Hong Kong to take them to the about us page on the website.

Speaker 2  58:07
Yes, because they don't that makes a lot more sense, because they're going to be like, Who are these company? Who's these people? You know, they're not going

Lisa Galea  58:14
to know this page has got a lot of information that probably could be like, five pages

Speaker 2  58:19
crowded. It's gonna Yeah, so it's gonna scare them away. We could

Lisa Galea  58:23
split this off, yes, right? So that you had, like, the one that's like, who are we? About Us, and then one that's like, why Emery? Because that's, that's like, all those sections.

Speaker 1  58:40
I And just the front page. And honestly, Liz, I think that will do because the more we do on here,

Lisa Galea  58:48
is this going to the same? When I go to governance, do I just go down the page? Oh my God, what's happened? That's the thing. I started looking, Oh, you look at it, you're like, oh my god, oh my god, I'm gonna have to do it more. And there's so many pages, yeah, no, there's so many pages that's was, like, you're better off getting bots that you can write stuff for it, because we'll never get, you know, like, I think this is a whole new design. I just really do think, just think

59:20
on updating that top line there where

Lisa Galea  59:25
it says, like, product, oh, you know, definitely we're going to fix the menu. And I think on the homepage we should fix that back try, like, I'm not going to panic about the website this week, because I'm going to finish the

Speaker 1  59:38
deck that can be in the next week, even first half of the week after exactly

Lisa Galea  59:45
so you're flying out, right? This is the least urgent, because they're not even going to see you to three days in, yeah. And so we'll see what's left. And what also will happen is, remember, we'll have all those now transport pictures. Yeah, we can add them to the website, because I'm already made, yeah, so like the map that I've done, of this is all our distributors. Well, that's an image. We can just add the website. So we're we're starting to build assets that like, as we make the deck, we might be able to go, okay, cool. We love this. Get that one banner at this because the distributor would be nice. All we ideally do is duplicate the homepage and put like their green one on here, right, and put like the catalog, and more, basically what we've put on those two cards, right? This is how we do, yeah, this is our system of checking. This is our audits, blah, blah, blah. But basically we just duplicate that, and we have some logos, and we say blah, blah, but we wait and see, but I'm assuming that the copy we're going to have in the brochure, we should be able to just bang it over here. Do you know what I mean? So then it's not so much planning, because I'm thinking, Oh my God, we've got to work out the text, but I think we'll have this text from just the positioning, just from the positioning. We'll have that copy. So that would be so let's just leave the website in terms of we'll do these things. I will going to get her to do the half day I'm going to try and tidy up. Has she got what about the blogs? I was like, That's what I said to get in, because that's really what you need to be sharing on socials. That's what I told her to do.

Speaker 2  1:01:29
Yeah, she's not doing that. Well. She says she's writing all of these blogs. She says she is, and she's posting it to socials, but,

Speaker 1  1:01:39
well, the last one we don't there is September.

Lisa Galea  1:01:43
Well, I will look at one blog, because, again, look. I mean, there's no way that's your font. That's what it was. Just annoying me. Everywhere I went, like, straight away we're like, and so that's the first thing I'm coming to look at. I don't really want that to be the case, so I will look. But she should be doing blogs, because that is part of the social that we're being active. Yeah? And we want to make sure that, like if you said, Go and look at this,

1:02:17
I need to find Yeah.

Lisa Galea  1:02:20
You get her doing. We choose them. And it's like you though, make sure these are here, that we need them for the as social proof, so that way she could just be sitting here, plonking away. It scares me that she's running anything, but I think we need to. They're not bad. This is one done that, at least is when

Speaker 1  1:02:43
pictures she wouldn't have actually written this. She would have put it off chat.

1:02:56
Well, she writes everything in chat, everything

Lisa Galea  1:03:00
to take these out like she's not editing. I think, I think that that's what you're Yeah, I sent the bot. Oh, I will make sure that tomorrow she's got the case study. I have given her access to your final folder, green, because gone on to that yet, because I like, but I've got everything you should have, and it's above and beyond, like, what you would need. Like, it's like, I think they put a quote in it, like, 74,000 just for everything. And I was like, okay, so laughing, but I'm gonna go through us. Okay. Have they got this? Have they got that? Because when they're talking to you, you need to be like, Bob, here you go. We can help. We're here to help you, and we know what they're going to be asking for. Mum.

Speaker 1  1:04:18
Mum mentioned we had a little marketing catch up for the conference. And Mum said, Oh, they're very high tech, and they were no Well, the specs and everything. And then it reminded me, oh, gosh, are we updating the spec sheets as well? Because I know I debt hasn't started on doing them,

Speaker 2  1:04:36
to be honest. We don't want to give them too much technical information, because they're notorious copycats as

1:04:41
well. Yeah,

Lisa Galea  1:04:47
is that tool that you were talking about Helena? Because I'm like, I'm just trying to work out, but I really want to make sure that what I do is valuable, and I think she can copy and paste. Is the tool in terms of working out? The maths like with AI, because that would also position you as legally using AI to help you.

Speaker 1  1:05:07
Is this what you mentioned during the how many case cuts, how many sinks you need, how many washes you need, per your capacity?

Lisa Galea  1:05:15
Is that useful for those people? Are they going to need that? Are they those

1:05:19
people? It would be good. Yeah.

Lisa Galea  1:05:22
Did you tell me exactly what you need that to work out? Isabelle, because I can build you a tool that does that. Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:05:30
So it's, uh, basically works out how many operating theaters they have, how many procedures they do per operating theater, and then it works out how the, if you want the capacity of like a nine din trolley, is what they call The trays, the trays the nine trade trolley or the 12 trade six trolley, and then go work out, actually, how many trolleys in their facility do they need to keep a smooth production?

Lisa Galea  1:06:12
Have you got that mass like you've got the spreadsheet you use?

Speaker 2  1:06:17
I've I've got some math, but it's not explained really clearly.

Speaker 1  1:06:25
I do want to get Benoit to do up a spreadsheet for it. He'll know exactly.

Lisa Galea  1:06:30
I mean, you've told me, I can work that mess out if you just give me the basics. Give me the basics, and then I'll see if I need help again, I'm going to put these as like nice to have. Like that. We've got to get the other stuff. So it's like, this is what we've got. But it's like, that would be something, if we can make something little and small that's like, Oh, here's a tool.

Speaker 1  1:06:56
It would be fantastic if it was a little chatbot on the website that said, And you, are you designing a

Lisa Galea  1:07:01
Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:07:04
are you needing some new logistics in your CST or your theater or something?

Lisa Galea  1:07:08
Yeah, and you go to that page, and what is also, what I've realized is amazing for SEO, because they stay on your pages so long, so you should be able to, we should be able to just bang. We should be able to just make that up in HTML. Fingers crossed. I mean, I've never tried to

1:07:31
do that math table. I've

Lisa Galea  1:07:33
got going on. I'm pretty good. I think

Speaker 1  1:07:38
case cart flyer as well. Yeah, on that one. So

Lisa Galea  1:07:41
that would be a great you could go, oh, go to our case, cut tools, and you can work out how many you need. You see what I mean, it's like, yeah, we're the expert. We're providing that. And I'm going

Speaker 2  1:07:50
sort of a bit different rounded numbers, because depending on what type of surgery, depends on how many trays they need,

1:08:00
yeah, yeah. That's why it's got three

Speaker 2  1:08:01
to six, because it's like, Okay, how many different surgeries? Like, if you have an orthopedic surgery, you've got like, four trays, compared to an eye surgery where you've got one, yeah?

Lisa Galea  1:08:12
No, we'll put, like, a special, like, all of the stuff we're putting, even, like, with the toe, you know, we're just making this up, you know, disclaimer, disclaimer. It's nice, and I will try Helena to because I ran I've got this prompt to see if I can make this my one. But like, even though we haven't got images, you can, actually, yeah, that looks great. So you at least you can see, like, ideally, then she'd be putting images in. But I've just made this with AI and then just plunked it into mine, like the HTML code. So if we could just get that line, and then we'll worry about adding photos after, because that would be nice, you know, like, there's a little picture of Lisa, all different ages, but like, the same with you, it's like, oh, when you click on it, we see a bit more of an image, which is this, then easy to do, but that's like, again, a nice to have, because we're going to see how we go. But when they're they're quite fun. If I can, like, you know, I haven't tried it with the new AI, so, you know, be like, Oh, how good can I get. But that's I'll do all the other things. First, everything is, we've been doing very good. I'm happy with your we're all happy with your vision.

Speaker 1  1:09:26
Yeah. And the only thing Lisa, if we could add when you're doing the social stuff, could you work on an email banner that we can put at the bottom of our signatures? Because the one that she sent us that I put in the chat. I don't think it explains very well the conference that we're going to.

Lisa Galea  1:09:47
I'll be definitely doing that now, when you do, when you do the banner, right? So in your email, in your email signature, does she send it you? And you have to put it in there. Do? Yeah, okay, that's not okay, because I imagine you've got distributors, or you've got anybody you know, like, if you up what we want with HBP, I would just upload a new banner whenever I wanted that was a new ad, and everyone in the whole company is it

Speaker 1  1:10:18
changed, yeah, that's what they used to do at Channel server. Yeah, it's like, what? You just upload

Lisa Galea  1:10:22
one picture, and we just always call it the same name, and everyone's just got it, like, find, you know, image, Emery, email, banner, and I just go and replace it in, like, upload it to this website. And I can do a recording, because I it's obviously okay I write that down because we need a HTML email. But I've got lots of templates, but I'm hoping AI should be to write that. So normally, I just put the HTML code in there, which is not as set out as your banner is, and it's just got a blank you can upload a white one if you want. Do you know what I mean said, then no one sees one. But if, if you do like Hong Kong show, and then after the Hong Kong you could say Merry Christmas, like I do a merry Christmas one. Yeah, right. So it'd be like, every month. That was like, part of what I did with whatever was the theme of the month, whatever was coming up, yeah. I did that banner for their email. I did three sizes, and we pulled one into the back portal. So that's how we knew the ads were going in. It was like, your emails have it, and then it was also on a side banner in the portal, and I just uploaded three every time we did a change of campaign. So that would be the ideal setup, because you don't want sales people, everybody changing,

Speaker 1  1:11:43
touching their emails. Sorry, ladies, I didn't realize, but I have a meeting at a meeting at three

Lisa Galea  1:11:47
o'clock. No, you go, go, go, do your thing. That's fine. I will write now. You said you're good with casual. I've got the values to finish off. They ended up really sounding down to earth. And I was like, I think that's actually good. I just wanted to check with you. You wrote that it actually sounds quite Aussie, not Aussie, Aussie, but it sounded like, you know, I think how the rest of the world thinks we're that. And I was like, You guys cool with that, because I don't think we are. We're a little bit more sophisticated than that normally. We're a little bit fancy of these normally. But I was like, I think these guys, you know, we want to be down to earth, don't we?

Speaker 1  1:12:22
Yeah, and we do have to remember that we are in a sheet of metal manufacturing business,

Lisa Galea  1:12:28
yes, like, with HPP, like, I'm, like, I'm with the men having a smoker basically, because those are the people. I mean, your guys are healthy because, but yeah, these are down to earth humans. So that's it. They're workers, especially the builders, even all of them are they're all, yeah, they're all workers. So all right, you go do your meeting, and I will keep on it. We've still got two weeks, so I feel weird. Don't panic, but I want her to be making stuff, because I'm like,

Speaker 1  1:12:56
I would just if we could get her the social stuff ASAP, then she can have something to work on, yeah,

1:13:01
because I'd love to start posting about

Lisa Galea  1:13:04
it like I've already got. I mean, I've got your Hong Kong, I'll do a

1:13:08
post next Tuesday, and we want, yeah, should we do a lead up, like, one this week?

1:13:17
Yeah, we're spending almost 75 grand to go there. I think you should be posting every

Lisa Galea  1:13:22
So, yeah, because the algorithm like, I'm paying someone like, if you look at me on Instagram, in anywhere, actually on LinkedIn, is why I'm paying for it. I'm not posting because I can't do it. Every day I'm shitted it. But the girl does it like, I pay someone like, a grand and a half, because you have to do that, because it's, we're just training the algorithm. It's not for humans. They don't even see it exactly all, especially with yours. We know there's only three people on the on LinkedIn looking right? So it doesn't matter. We're doing this for Google, yes. So that's what we want. It's every single day. You don't need barning people. So, oh, look, I've got, I've got my bots, mate, I can just be like, some funnel content, okay, like, is that so, because I feel like they need value, go, go go, my friend, go go, friend. I need anything. I'll let you know. Have the best day on purpose. Bye. Bye.
