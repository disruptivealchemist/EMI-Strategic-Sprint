## 1. Risk: Lack of a Clear and Actionable Plan

*   **Risk Owner:** James Emery
*   **Probability:** 4/5 (High)
*   **Impact:** 5/5 (Critical)
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   **Action 1:** Create a detailed project plan with a work breakdown structure (WBS), task owners, and deadlines for all 6 weeks. **Deadline:** End of Week 1.
    *   **Action 2:** Implement a project management tool (e.g., Notion) to track progress and provide visibility to all stakeholders. **Deadline:** End of Week 1.
    *   **Action 3:** Hold a daily 15-minute stand-up meeting to review progress and identify roadblocks. **Deadline:** Daily, starting Week 2.
*   **Cost of Mitigation vs. Cost of Risk Occurrence:**
    *   **Cost of Mitigation:** Low. Requires time for planning and daily check-ins.
    *   **Cost of Risk Occurrence:** High. Project failure, wasted resources, and team demotivation.
*   **Dependencies:** This risk is a dependency for all other risks. A lack of a clear plan will exacerbate all other potential problems.

## 2. Risk: Stakeholder Misalignment and Decision-Making Gridlock

*   **Risk Owner:** James Emery
*   **Probability:** 4/5 (High)
*   **Impact:** 5/5 (Critical)
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   **Action 1:** Create a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix to clarify roles and responsibilities for key decisions. **Deadline:** End of Week 1.
    *   **Action 2:** Schedule a weekly 1-hour stakeholder meeting to review progress, discuss challenges, and make key decisions. **Deadline:** Weekly, starting Week 1.

*   **Cost of Mitigation vs. Cost of Risk Occurrence:**
    *   **Cost of Mitigation:** Low. Requires time for meetings and creating the RACI matrix.
    *   **Cost of Risk Occurrence:** High. Project delays, team frustration, and potential for the project to stall completely.
*   **Dependencies:** This risk is closely linked to the "Lack of a Clear and Actionable Plan" risk. A clear plan can help to align stakeholders.

## 3. Risk: The "Shiny New Toy" Syndrome

*   **Risk Owner:** Helena Emery
*   **Probability:** 3/5 (Medium)
*   **Impact:** 4/5 (High)
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   **Action 1:** Mandate that the first two weeks of the sprint are focused exclusively on strategy (brand, target audience, content) before any new tools are considered. **Deadline:** Weeks 1-2.
    *   **Action 2:** For any proposed new tool, create a business case that outlines the problem it solves, the expected ROI, and the resources required for implementation and maintenance. **Deadline:** Ongoing.
    *   **Action 3:** Prioritize the use of existing tools (e.g., Notion, Odoo) before introducing new ones. **Deadline:** Ongoing.
*   **Cost of Mitigation vs. Cost of Risk Occurrence:**
    *   **Cost of Mitigation:** Low. Requires discipline and a focus on strategy.
    *   **Cost of Risk Occurrence:** Medium to High. Wasted budget on unused tools, and a lack of a coherent strategy.
*   **Dependencies:** This risk is linked to "Insufficient Resources and Expertise." A lack of expertise can make the team more susceptible to the allure of "easy" solutions from new tools.

    *   **Action 3:** Prioritize project tasks based on the team's existing skills to ensure early wins and build momentum. **Deadline:** Ongoing.
*   **Cost of Mitigation vs. Cost of Risk Occurrence:**

    *   **Cost of Risk Occurrence:** High. Inability to complete the project, poor quality work, and team burnout.
