# Risk Management Plan: 6-Week Branding and Marketing Sprint

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Risk Management Plan for the 6-week branding and marketing sprint. Its purpose is to formally document the process for identifying, analyzing, and responding to potential risks that could impact the project's success. This plan is a living document and should be reviewed and updated weekly as part of the project tracking process.

## 2. Risk Management Process

1.  **Identify:** Any team member can identify a new risk at any time. Risks will be formally reviewed during the weekly stakeholder status meeting.
2.  **Analyze:** Each identified risk will be assessed for its probability of occurrence and its potential impact on the project, both on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high). The Risk Score is calculated by multiplying Probability x Impact.
3.  **Respond:** For each risk, a response strategy will be developed. This will include a primary mitigation strategy (actions to reduce the likelihood or impact) and a contingency plan (actions to be taken if the risk occurs).
4.  **Monitor:** The Risk Owner is responsible for monitoring the status of their assigned risks and reporting on them in the weekly status meeting.

## 3. Risk Register

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Category | Probability (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Score | Risk Owner | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-01** | The scope of the AI tool expands beyond the initial requirements, causing development delays. | Scope / Technical | 4 | 5 | 20 | Isabelle | Strictly adhere to the initial requirements document. All change requests must go through a formal approval process with James. | Descope non-essential features to meet the deadline. The primary focus is a tool for the November trip. |
| **R-02** | Conflicting feedback from stakeholders on creative assets leads to endless revision cycles and delays. | Project Management | 3 | 4 | 12 | James | Implement a structured review process with a single point of contact (Helena) for consolidating feedback. James to be the final arbiter on conflicting feedback. | Allocate a specific, time-boxed period for revisions. If consensus can't be reached, James will make the final decision. |
| **R-03** | The creation of content (copywriting) for the marketing assets takes longer than anticipated, creating a bottleneck for the design phase. | Resource / Schedule | 3 | 4 | 12 | Helena | Dedicate a resource to content creation early in the project. Write the copy for the most critical assets first. | Hire a freelance copywriter to accelerate the content creation process. |
| **R-04** | Delays from the external printing vendor jeopardize the availability of physical assets for the trip. | External | 2 | 5 | 10 | Helena | Select the printing vendor and get production timelines in Week 2. Submit final files with at least 3 buffer days before the vendor's deadline. | Have a backup plan to produce a smaller run of essential assets at a local, faster-turnaround printer. |
| **R-05** | A key team member (Helena or Isabelle) becomes unavailable due to illness or other unforeseen circumstances. | Resource | 2 | 5 | 10 | James | Ensure all project documentation and work-in-progress is stored in a central, accessible location. Cross-train a backup resource on the basics of the AI tool. | Re-plan the sprint to focus only on the absolute most critical assets for the trip. Engage a freelancer to backfill the role if possible. |
| **R-06** | The final AI tool has critical bugs or is not adopted by the team due to a poor user experience. | Technical / User Adoption | 3 | 3 | 9 | Isabelle | Conduct thorough User Acceptance Testing (UAT) in Week 5. Create a simple user guide and hold a training session. | Prioritize fixing any critical bugs that prevent the core functionality from working. Gather user feedback for a V2 of the tool after the trip. |
