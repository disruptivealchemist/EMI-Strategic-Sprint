## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the 6-week branding and marketing sprint. The project is decomposed into its major phases and then into smaller, manageable work packages and tasks. For each task, an estimated duration and its dependencies on other tasks are identified.
