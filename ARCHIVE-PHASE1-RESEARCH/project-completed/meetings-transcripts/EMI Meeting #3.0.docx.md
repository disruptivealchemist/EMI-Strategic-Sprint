**Karen Doane**  00:39  
Hello, hello, hello. Sorry, girls. I don't know what happened there. I did it my on my phone. I don't know why I can't make appointments on my phone. Zoom. It crazy. Did you have that link, or was a different link?

**Helena E**  00:55  
We've had a Google Ah,

**Karen Doane**  00:58  
that's fine. I knew Google link. I updated it to zoom. It won't let me do that on the phone. Then I updated it on my computer. But maybe, how are you guys? How are you guys going?

**Helena E**  01:09  
Very good. I was trying to figure out how to turn this up. I just did it till 50\.

**Karen Doane**  01:22  
That's right, this we can still hear, that's good, that's good. I am just getting I shut down all my Windows did like a so I was like, shut everything down. Let's start fresh. It's good idea. So I just thought, because I was actually and I just was wondering. While I was waiting, I wandered around and was plugging in their hard drive. Because I think the easiest way like to the capability statements I've done so many, I must have spare ones. Sometimes I do three logos for people. Do you know what I mean? Like, I do a lot of stuff. So, like, there's lots of things that I've never used, and I feel like otherwise, when I even if we get a debt helping me, I just feel like I don't know if we'd get I want to make sure we get ready for the conference. So today, I really wanted to make sure you want to you were clear, and I was clear what we need for the conference, so we prioritize that. So in the folder, you'll see there is a planty thing. I'm only getting organized for these bots. Yeah, well, listen as I get in the folder working in it's our share folder. So I've been on the job all day, my friends, it's also I was in Papua New Guinea through meetings yesterday. I think that's thrown off my my cot was weird for that. Anytime I looked and I was like, that's about the guinea time. That was cool that I'm doing it. I'm working there.

03:14  
So we're all good.

**Karen Doane**  03:17  
All right. So now we have got, I'm just getting, like, I'm not finding what I want. I'm sure there's a folder I've got, because I did so many for people in Western Australia with those miners. So I know I got so many, you know, like, you just keep downloading them. And I even got them off my girlfriend, because she I was like, give me your stuff on them so I can see what they look like. So I had loads which would be good, but I found one I think that is useful. All right, so we are going into your drive. Shared you're in here. So in the digital asset management we have got, isn't there, like a big

04:17  
I've done a full might be my one. Level.

**Karen Doane**  04:23  
I've got the knowledge bases. I've got the target audience stuff sorted. I did want to, I did have a look at, like, what they were looking at. Do you know any I was like, What are these people like? So I think, like, in terms of looking at the design, can you see they're like, these are that these are the brands they like and what they will buy in terms of your tier one. So they're definitely like, Helvetica, your basic. They like it square and clean. But, see, but see, they've got a bit of this humor. See how that's like the it's. Daniels, because that's like, he man. So they're like, they've got to be like, they've got that. They think they're cool in a weird way, okay, but they are quite because they were that architecty feel, yeah, do you know what I mean? But I don't think they're full architecting because they feel that's wanky. They're more like, yeah, do you know what I mean? I think that's why there's, like, that sort of humor, and it's like, but they still would have seen nice design because of the architecture. Do you see what I mean, like, compared to, like, average humans, they see nicer things. It's like that, you know. So I thought that was just good, because I just wanted to get my brain around what we were aiming for. What's that one don't know something at the end. So that was good. We were on that. But I've got to what do you think you need for the conference. Let me double check this is recording. I'm sure.

**Helena E**  06:04  
I think what would be really handy is to have the brand guidelines updated and the front page of the current website, at least in our correct messaging for the conference.

**Karen Doane**  06:24  
Do you think you would have to give them anything?

**Helena E**  06:29  
Oh, we will have to give them, like, catalogs and stuff. Yeah. So we're just looking at time frame. Like we don't have the time to because the

**Karen Doane**  06:38  
brand guide is like, I've got that pretty much sorted, right? It's really sorted. We just need to, it's already done. I just need to have got it in a picture. It hasn't got a picture. And also, I'd say it's like, what I find is, now we've done stage I'd say, like, stage two of it, it tends to be that I start making, like, the capability and go, Oh, that doesn't really work. Okay, so I've got a couple like I've added in the extra. Have you seen any of that? No, I have done a I have got all your colors and everything. Because I've done actually added in a couple of extra colors. Okay, yeah, because that's what I think is really hard for us. So we've got the fonts.

**Helena E**  07:31  
Let me go to my we've got three really strong colors,

**Karen Doane**  07:35  
yeah, so we need to as well remember that that's, I mean, we've got the, I've got the in the guide, but when what you really need to remember is the full strength colors in your brand are like, shouting capitals, yeah. So you don't want to use them all over the page, because it's like no one knows where to look, because everyone's shouting everywhere. So think of them as, like, shades and tints. So you stay, don't you, you can use, like, you know, 25% of the color and then only the strong color. But the problem is, with your navy, it would just, it's the red goes to pink. Okay, so I've got the same issue with mine, right? So it's an issue. So it doesn't mean that we don't really have pink, we don't really have red to do, do we as well? Let's see where I got properly. I was like, I don't need to look at it. Do you see what I mean? I was like, right? Got it in my brain. Now we need to start just playing with it. But you can see my screen, so I added in the teal. So we've got the teal and the steel, right? So you've got the surgical still for cleaning, so we can use those, but the logo is then the red and the Do you see what I mean? We don't use the red or because we, it's like, we keep having to use red, and it's so strong. Then I've also got the Marone, which, if we do need these are really, like subsets, if we had that for like, a a product or an area, you know, like just to because a night that is a nice color, that is a nice goes with them. See, it's fine, everything. So I've just put them as our subset, because that's what will happen now, as we see, we use them, then I have got, like, your safety Amber and compliance green to make sure that, so we could have those pops where it's like with safety, or this is what's this for. Yeah, nothing to do with the logo. But so I've just added those in, and I've got all the so I have done why we're doing it, and all how we're going to use it. But I was just like, I need to make this pretty in a book right now, because now I need to make sure it works. Alright. So we have got the logo, two in the variety, like this, the different varieties. So we've got those. And. Really, where are we here? I do feel you need a Sarah for quotes, just for Occasionally, when we put something in, it just adds so much weight. So that was the only thing. Which one is that Baskerville, I don't That's what went with them, but I think it's too light. Doesn't change it. There you go. I was in charge. It's Georgia. There you go. So basically, then we've got more choices of color, but we've also got, then all the shades of those colors. Okay, so that will give you a lot more. When you put that on there, you can just quickly add now, actually, I should do that for that would help, because I think, like, I don't know, that's when I think maybe a debt I'll share with her. Now, this far with you, I wanted to show you stuff, and then, because she's like, Oh, the brand guy that's going to take me. I'm like, one, I agree with you. The font we don't need to do anything apart from the existing website. We just want to change the fonts to what they should be and make it as good as possible. I'd like to change the menu items. Do you know what I mean? That's all we really need to do, so that it just communicates immediately. This is what we're going to do. But I wouldn't be wasting time, like, making I would like you to have a case study that they could download that's relevant to them at the conference, that will add, like, when they get there. Do you know what I mean? So you can add some value with what you've got, and I think we've got enough time to do that. Do you see what I mean?

**Helena E**  11:43  
We should be able to get a like we went to America. They gave us a free delegate list. We were allowed to send one email to them before we got there. Yeah. And I think that on that EDM, we should be able to link to a blog or something that we already have, because we have a few already written. They will just need to be updated with fonts and colors and

**Karen Doane**  12:13  
Okay, so this is exactly what you want, like, what we need to sell, to send them in advance. What are you going to have them look at in terms of, is there a case study? Even if you've got it already, that's what we need to get together so that I can say, all right, I'll practice these colors out, because that's what actually happens as you start using them. You like, you go, Oh, I'm not sure. Being work. When you when you start using it, it starts going, Oh, I get it. It doesn't work, or it does work. I also did yesterday for you, my little brain. I did a logo for you, a stainless one that was just all stainless. That's what I did. I actually have added that already. I'm adding just everything to the drive, even the work in progress. That's what I ended up doing. So it's like, okay, you're just gonna have to see it's halfway, because that way I won't be able to work with the debt otherwise. So I really wanted to make sure. I mean, I don't mind if you see it, you understand it's growing, but in here we had your identity assets, stainless, which I thought could be quite good for the like. It could be good on some documents.

13:47  
Occasionally, get your colors in here.

**Karen Doane**  14:12  
Little There we go. And what have I missed out in the middle? What white? Oh, yes, so the white, we should put the tool first. The tool actually looks quite nice with that red. Yeah. And also, what we'll do is because I'm theming it up, as you see, so when you're doing a color theme, you're not really doing the color theme of the primary colors, because then I go and click in Canva or in Adobe Color theme, I don't want every color used in one go, you see, I mean, so my color themes like a shade, and there'll be two whites and four light ones, yeah, so that way it means we'll be able to make artwork quicker. Go. Go. So really, all of those colors, so you get to use in shapes. The only one even that's not too bad, the pink. But we'll probably wouldn't be using pink, but it's much nicer. Now, if we use this color, these is what you're missing at the moment. And when you add those softer colors, everything will go and it's easier for people to use, because that's where I find they're like, oh, it all looks hard, but it's easy when you use shades because they will match. Do you know what I mean? So I'll put together some basics for that, and the same with this. I just thought, it's, I thought it's quite nice to have a, like, there's some times where you don't want to be, like, standing out as the most important thing on the page, yeah, because you are a strong logo, which is a good thing. But it's like, I just thought it's quite nice. We don't know might use that. I had just thought good idea. As I was making it, I was looking for stainless effects. And also I made an AI stainless effect. So quite hard to find that it actually looks dangerous. So the other thing I will need from you, which I'll do recording from this afterwards, I need when I'm going to look and say, I was doing your capability statement, right? I had a look at it. Yes, the images that are in there, you would know, what is the best images? Do you see what I mean? So I'm starting to go through all the photos. Now. I don't have time to do that. I have time to, like put together the template, but I don't be choosing photos, so I one. I will put some in there. But if you have like, this is great, yeah, this is a must do for the thing I am going to go a debt. It's given me some good case study. Things from your mum and her have been putting together. So I'll run through that without people for the stainless conference, and say what one would be most relevant, and see if you've got any photos or anything I need for that. The capability statements did I put you in here? That's what if I tried to just use everything on the drive, and it's just Adobe is not friendly every time we go to do a Save, then it's like, no, you can't find the drive.

17:32  
So it's driving me nuts. Signed up with different folders, okay? I was just pulling them in for you somewhere.

**Helena E**  17:41  
Melissa, what's the style scape?

**Karen Doane**  17:43  
A style scape is where I would put everything together like this, as we're building it. Do you see what I mean? So the end, everyone will feel it, yes, as like this is our people. This is how it feels, really, just to communicate what you know, these are our Icons. Are our main sort of thing. So, yeah, that's sort of like more I would do quickly. So then the putting together, and even the same with the brand guide, like the I think that it'll just be developed normally. They're sort of developing as I'm doing work. What we've got done, like the identity, the basic like, what she's got in here. I mean, I just think one, this should be quite quick to update. If I said, here's the new colors, right? But really, the guide we want, I think, is more of a it's not a brand guide saying this is the colors. It's who we are. These are our values and why we exist. Guide, more of a storytelling than it is and how to communicate. Yeah. Do you see what I mean? That's more what it is. It's like what our people care about, what we care about. That's what's sort of missing more than the colors, because the color bits quite easy. Okay, so that's what I am thinking. Let me just do capability. This is, oh, they are, I gave

19:18  
them. Okay, no, I was copying them somewhere.

**Karen Doane**  19:23  
So I was thinking like, we want it to be more, you know, like this. This is our values. This is that I think you need a capability. The capability is the key thing, because I don't think they give a shit about your brand. And the only people who gives a shit about that guide is the designer, and you've only got one, so I can't see us going off brand. That's why, you know, I mean, it's like, it's nice to have and it will build out. But I'm like, That's Odette said, Oh, that'll keep me busy. I was like, That is not going to be our priority, because I don't really care about that guy. Right? I care about this because I think the capability is what's going to sell, and it will have the quotes that are relevant to those people, and we have to keep it clean. So I felt this was a major need, that we'd have this so your company would have your certifications, because they do care about those, you know, like that sort of stuff. I don't think I even use this, right? So anyway, it will change anyway, as I was doing it, but I'm thinking we just use this as a template. It's going to be the quickest way we're doing it. Yes, do you think so normally? I mean, there's other ones, more designy ones, but this is what, basically, I think we need to have in there is so I really need from you. So we've said now we need a capability. You said you'd be sending them other things as well. So it's really like, it's not a brand guide. We need, we really need to be specific about that customer journey of what's going to happen. So tell me

**Helena E**  21:03  
exactly, because has gone off brand.

**Karen Doane**  21:07  
Oh, yeah, no, the debt will be working with me. She will have the brand guide, my friend, it is in Adobe anyway. Yes, it's locked in anyway as a library in Adobe, so everything's in there. Yeah, so she will have that guide? Yeah, no, I'll be strict, because I'm also going to, I'm I'm building at the same time, like a brand governance bot, so the knowledge base will be building up. But that's a thing is, normally, I have to see it to check it. Yes, do you know what I mean? I need to, like, was I right? I think it's okay. But I like, I need to start moving. And then I'm like, I'll tweak that so it's like this, okay, but we are but really, even then, you're not going to see it, because it's so big, there's so many information things that no human wants to look through that like you will see it, but it's like, really, that. So you can just run through the bot and make sure everything's coming out. Am I being correct? And also for you to check things, but we'll get the basic guide. You can what you guys, I think, think, is the guide that will be done, because they'll take five minutes. You can see, I've basically put the colors and fonts. Is basically, I'm thinking more of that story. Why would they buy off you? What are they doing? So more of a front facing company guide, maybe not even so much. Well, we it can be a capabilities, because is that what they would want, or is it about us, or is it an about us? So that's what they want, isn't it? It's not an About Us catalog. It's an No no, it's

**Helena E**  22:47  
okay. We can do what they want us to do.

**Karen Doane**  22:51  
Do they have any requirements in those like, do you have examples of what is required because of those stainless from that stainless point of view that I wouldn't know about,

**Helena E**  23:02  
um, nothing that's probably not already in that

23:07  
your one. Okay, cool,

**Helena E**  23:09  
yeah, this needs update. Probably just needs the wording.

**Karen Doane**  23:13  
That's what I'm going to run that through the wording and put that and then I'll give it back to you. So what I'm going to end up doing after this meeting is, that's why I don't want to overwhelm you my so young, I will. What I thought now is really, you can do the checking. So I've made, like, the tier one builders, and like, they've got their own sheets and stuff.

**Helena E**  23:39  
So my brain please. Can you give my personal email access to that Google Drive as well?

**Karen Doane**  23:48  
Yes, of course, yes. Sometimes that's a pain, then it's easier on your phone. Yeah, because it's really the looking through the stuff. Because I'm looking through it, I'm obviously doing it through the computer, right? So I'm doing lots of stuff, and then I'm sitting here reading things, but I still know that you will be so much quicker at going, No, yes, even though I think now it's pretty close. Okay, so I will share with you the folders. Where's yours? There you are. Put it on the side, so I can get you quick. So I'm building up your compliance documents. All your all your stuff is in this number five. So that's why that that is in there, and you've got your brand positioning myself. This is so this is all your work so far. That's all what you've got. Okay, you've given me. Yes. So do you think you should go through that and mark up this is relevant for this conference? Oh, yeah. Is there anything in there that's relevant? Do you know what I mean? Like, I need to know, what would you be giving them for this conference? Because it really needs to be the same everywhere. Yeah, and once we go in, it's not that hard if, because, even if it just got I would really, for me, you should have a standard case study template, a standard, you know, like scope of work, all those templates, and then we'll be just pasting this stuff on it. So if you list in here, who it's for, maybe in terms of our targets, should we put that? Does that help us? Because I will, I'd say, if you think, then a lot of the stuff for

**Helena E**  25:53  
the conference, the target will be, the more either the more procurement, healthcare, no,

**Karen Doane**  26:04  
no builders, no builders that I thought so this one will be about, this really about, it's a sterilization conference. That's what they're going to care about. And you seeing them about that custom design and the long, lasting positioning. Sustainability. So, yeah, that's what I thought the conference we are doing, the the target audience, people that I need you to look over so you can see I'm going, I'm building up all the things, okay, and building up so they're going, I've got your capability, but, yeah, I think that the spec sheets like that would be the like, do you? I'm assuming you have a spec sheet. So we want to make

**Isabelle Em**  26:53  
sure that is really basic. It definitely does not. It's not in our branding at all. It's not the engineers downstairs put it together and you can

**Karen Doane**  27:05  
tell they put it Okay, well, that needs to be so this is the things I had down as because I'm sure then through a couple of examples, yeah. So if you the

**Speaker 1**  27:15  
template, they will fill, oh, they haven't got a template. They just, yeah, it's okay.

**Karen Doane**  27:25  
Well, in here, in this inbox, in that inbox, chuck it in there. Yeah, okay. Because that, I think, is like, I'm assuming they are going to want specs. They might want to talk to you about that, yes. So that's important. We will get that done, and that should be an easy job, like you see what I mean, something.

**Isabelle Em**  27:44  
A lot of our customers ask for once they buy product, like it's part there.

**Karen Doane**  27:50  
We buy spec Yeah, we have one. If we sell our products, all of ours have, like, MSDS and spec sheets, right? So you need to have that so, and this should be easy for us to make that Yeah, so a case study template which we're going to choose a case study that's relevant for the conference, and then template that up, then I've got a pitch deck would be ideal, right? That's your sales deck with 12 slides and your proof pillars and two case studies, right? So that was

28:22  
case studies she has given

**Karen Doane**  28:24  
I'm going to go through that, look through that now, and we'll see. I think let me just

**Helena E**  28:33  
done it with mom.

**Karen Doane**  28:35  
She's done there's quite a lot. There's quite a lot on the thing. So I was quiet area.

**Helena E**  28:42  
Yeah, and the sales deck could be good leads, because that could be something we could have as a revolving presentation on our TV screen, on our stand.

**Karen Doane**  28:50  
Yeah, that would be ideal that we could do in 12 decks, that pitch deck. So I was like, yes, the coup two case studies. Do you know what I mean, we do our best. But the pitch deck, I was like, That would be good. But that's why I mean, I'm I know if I need to pump this out, really, what I'm thinking is I'm getting the words in it laid out. And if Odette's finding pictures, and you guys are finding pictures, it should be I that's what I will not have time to do, as long as everyone's understanding that, because that's what takes it. So as long as we're working together, I can get that done. Okay, now, the booth banner, I thought we didn't need that, because you're not taking that, are you? We've already got a

29:31  
basic one, yeah, doing a general brand,

**Karen Doane**  29:35  
we're going to put nice to have

**Helena E**  29:39  
nice time. Yeah, we've actually, we already sent that over.

**Karen Doane**  29:42  
Yeah, so we in that is not that's future that's not even nice to have its future one that's future plan, that's future plan, excellent. And an order the audit file checklist per module, I think that was just really for me to do the brand. Which I don't think is anything to do with your thingy. That's nothing to do with that. All right, so we have got that all done, the compliance, but I like really crafted with care as your top banner. I think it's quite nice. And have you been using that for a long time? Yeah, I think it's like, it's clear, but then we go down that's like, the top level umbrella. Do you know like? But then I think we go down to that compliance by design, whatever, depending on the person they're more like the messaging, yeah, so that's what I thought when I looked at that. And I'll finish this off, but we would have so that was also remember I said about the honest blemish. So saying about that to give building the trust. So I've got that, and they would be going in the guides as well, and also how we talk about things, you know, and zero crevices, the short lead times and what they want complies with Australian standards, and not

**Isabelle Em**  31:15  
the Australian like medical standards, The Australian New Zealand standards. But then there's also Australian stainless standards, where you have to comply by, like, the stainless steel has to be up to a certain standard itself. So there's two, like, two different standards.

**Karen Doane**  31:33  
Yeah, excellent. So that's why, again, if I put that on and you're like, we can add more social proof on them, they care about that. Your guys you're going with, they really do more than the builders. Care that they get the box ticks. They don't really care that it is done. But those people who you're going to they do care like they do care. So they really are,

**Speaker 2**  32:01  
I've got all, you've got all the marketing things in there, anyway, if you wanted to look at them. So you've got that. And that was the websites of your competition. This was the target segments I have put in.

**Karen Doane**  32:17  
Alright, so I think I haven't knowledge based them, because I think that's what I think you need to go through and double check to say, yep, that is correct, yeah. Just have a look, and we'll go through and make sure this is how they feel. Because, again, once we get these sorted, I'm going to put them inside a bot so you can ask, and you can put your stuff in, okay? So you don't have to, because it is hard for you to remember this and keep going back and checking, but I do think you want to understand it, so it's just about how we talk about it, how's the best way to communicate it, and what's making them worry? Like no one really cares about them. That's what they feel like, right? So that's what we want to say. We see you, you know, we know that you're you're dealing with all the hidden germs, you know, and you feel hidden food. You know what I mean. You feel hidden. You're dealing with hidden stuff, and it's such a high risk. But you know, we care about that. So that's like, really quickly. You know how we're talking to them. So obviously, there's those I I've been pasting and stuff in there, so I think you should check them. So the targets are in here. I mean, the pictures, I was not really worried too much. They're silly basic. I was just really seeing what they're doing. I'm not overly you're still getting weird words, but it was more for us just to get that was actually I downloaded their profiles from LinkedIn, right? Because you can go there and say about me, right? But that was your they did not use LinkedIn. No way. They really not great. Like, I'm talking like there was, like, one post and your your tier, one builder was the only one. This lady, there's nothing. There was really nothing at all. There was where. So, how are they meeting other people to do like? How would they find, I could say,

**Helena E**  34:25  
would be on LinkedIn, just looking so they won't couldn't be active. They won't be posting a lot. They won't be liking

**Karen Doane**  34:34  
I check their activities. I check their activities, their comments. They're not on there. They're doing nothing. Like there's like the there was nothing. It was really, really like, she's like, she was no way. Yeah, she would have an alpha. She had nothing. She was the lowest of all. So, but does she have decision to buy? Why? Or is she just someone who wants it? She is the decider.

**Helena E**  35:05  
He's not the decider, but she has. She can say no, we're not doing that, yeah, but she can't necessarily say we are yes, that's what we're doing. Yeah. She has

**Karen Doane**  35:16  
influence, yeah, okay,

**Helena E**  35:19  
but not doesn't have final decision, but she has

**Karen Doane**  35:22  
and who's making final decision, then

**Helena E**  35:27  
it would be out of those three, she would be telling the continue rep what the hospital wants. So there's someone with her that is actually at the hospital level, who is the CSD manager, yes, who will be telling her what the staff want, and then continue would be going back to John Holland, going, what did we put in the tender to say we could do and how do we fit this into that tender? Yeah, now and then ultimately, John Holland have the hospital budget to make sure that what they buy.

**Speaker 2**  36:10  
So, yeah, the accountants at the top eventually come into it, but like she's a influence on it, right? So I want you to tell me now what happens you're going to this conference, yes. What outcome Do you want to happen? Like, what is the customer journey there? It's like you're sending them

**Isabelle Em**  36:30  
a global distributor. We do. We also want more international brand recognition as well. Okay, so customers look at that and go, Oh, that's an Emory, okay,

**Helena E**  36:46  
Maria, I met them

**Karen Doane**  36:47  
sort of things. Yeah. Okay, so we're, that's the like that we can't measure, and we can probably, yes, guarantee we can do that, is building the international brand bit we can do that. Yes, we want to be recognized and remembered, is what I'm thinking. This is what I'm also thinking, is we I still don't feel like any of this shit is making you remembered. I'm feeling that you lovely girls might help. But yeah, the little teddy bear things, I don't know where they will be, the things they will be, the things that will help. This is what

**Speaker 3**  37:21  
we've got, a little he wears a little Emory. Oh, that's cute.

**Helena E**  37:27  
Industries t shirt, a little kangaroo.

**Speaker 2**  37:31  
I like that. People love that. I definitely and everyone loves kangaroos. Yes, that is excellent. I am also going to ask once we get this sorted, is there any tool that we could make for these people that would help them, like a mass type tool that we can use with AI? Do you know what I mean, like working something out, like the space, or what they need, like you said something about how many units they would need for the space. Is there a tool like that that we can make,

**Helena E**  38:03  
if they could upload their hospital room drawing and then an Emory industries AI tool suggested how to plan the CSD people might use that?

**Karen Doane**  38:19  
Would that help you? Would it help your workflow? Or is it not a useful workflow? Like, does it add value? Or would you decide to talk to them?

**Isabelle Em**  38:31  
Another one would be for, like, almost a calculator for transport trolleys and case cards. Oh, yeah.

**Helena E**  38:39  
So you've got one wash eye equals one. Yeah, you have

**Isabelle Em**  38:45  
so many theaters you are doing. How many procedures a day? How many dim trays per procedure, you know? And then all other goes, okay? You have nine theaters. You're doing 180 procedures. In a week. In a week, you need 57 case cards that hold this many in trays,

**Karen Doane**  39:09  
sort of thing. I think that's a great tool, because that's a tiny tool that's also going to make them want to talk to you you don't really want. They're going to get some dodgy thing off a plan from AI. And that's your custom level skill. But I think giving them numbers so they've got an idea, oh shit. It said, I need this many, and then I

**Helena E**  39:29  
need to meet that capacity to be able to, at the end of it, go, can I have a quote for that?

**Karen Doane**  39:36  
Yeah, it also gives them, it educates them when, before they come to you anyway. So that's a useful tool. So anything else that you think of, so I'm going to give you these things to look over. You're going to read through them, and you can cross out whatever and say, but so we get a really clean one to go inside the knowledge base. Okay. Mm. So what you like and what you don't like, that will be your job. While I'm just now going to start doing the design a bit, because I can update the stuff whenever, because I pretty much got them in my head anyway. Like, didn't mean, like, it's fine. So you guys go and do the little detailing thing, because that will take me a long time, and then also be thinking, Is there anything there's like that? Oh, that would be a really handy tool. Like that would add value to them, but I'm talking and lovely little tiny thing like that, they'll just make their life easier in their job with what they do. Obviously, yes, so showing again that you have thought about how they work and you care about what they do. So those things, I'll be asking. Ai, okay, so I'll probably give you a list. I will give you a list, and you'll say, yes, no, yes, no, but it's just would be nice. I thought if you could give that away as well as a little memory thing.

**Speaker 2**  41:09  
So at least then, you know it's, it's something again, that's going to grab some attention. But if it was valuable and useful, hopefully they would use it. So we have got, they've, you've basically sent them a letter so far. Give me the journey. What's happened? You've sent them an email to them. They're going to start coming to conference.

**Helena E**  41:32  
Yeah, I think that could be good at least, yeah, have that on the or at least a QR code or something they can scan into to that page.

**Karen Doane**  41:41  
That's what I was thinking. Go to just a QR code you can print out, which would be quick, or eat, like worst case, one post, or even just something, you know, like take away with the key QR code. But tell me what happens then? So you send them this, you go and set up. It's like an exhibition, yeah. And what happens you just standing there? That's it.

**Helena E**  42:05  
So they'll they'll walk around and they come to our stand, and they'll ask us a really enjoying question, because half of them probably have never heard of us.

**Karen Doane**  42:12  
What are they asking you? What are they asking you?

**Helena E**  42:17  
Where are you from? What is Emory Do you only do sinks. What do you what do you do? Why is your sink different to their sink? Something the questions we've got in America,

42:32  
I like this. They even go, I like this. That'll really work in my space.

**Helena E**  42:36  
How do I get at least and sort of that mean, yeah,

**Karen Doane**  42:42  
have you got a clear process for how you work with us? So, like, if we're doing this, no, so if we maybe should put that in that capability statement, because that would build trust too. Is like, Okay, this is how it works. You get in contact, we make an account, blah, blah, blah. So we need the step by step of how it works as an international person, yeah, so that they feel comfortable like we're talking top level, easy, but just so they can see how easy it is to work with you, and they're not thinking straight away, oh, what about sending from Australia, right? You've got to, straight away be like, That is no issue at all. We have this covered. We do it all the time. So we're like, put a testimonial on that page. Oh, Bob in America, received our shit. Do you know? Like, that's what we need to make them feel comfortable, that it's not a problem. So what else happens then after that? So they just keep talking to you. And then what normally happens?

**Isabelle Em**  43:43  
Then hopefully they place orders, yeah, no, they usually keep talking to us, and then sort of continue walking

**Helena E**  43:50  
around after, oh, after the after the trade show.

**Karen Doane**  43:54  
Do they come back and talk to again? Or do they normally just some

**Helena E**  43:57  
people, do. Some people that find out information valuable. We usually go back to where they come from and bring a higher up person back to the stand. Yes, especially other exhibitors. Yes.

**Isabelle Em**  44:11  
Other exhibitors are actually okay. Trey, others really feel we're sort of targeting because we want them to we want to supply them. We want to supply them, and they supply the customers in the long run,

**Helena E**  44:24  
okay, the legs on the ground.

**Karen Doane**  44:27  
Okay, so that is what did those people want to see? Then, from you,

**Helena E**  44:37  
they want to see that we can meet their demands. Probably that a lot of questions about capacity, like, if we took you on, could you meet our needs in a eight week time? And how long would it? Would it take for us from order to get the products to wherever they and they're a lot more interested in price on. Spot, yes. Like, if we were to order a sync of you, how much would a sink? Yeah, be?

**Karen Doane**  45:04  
And do you give that to them straight away? We give them a ballpark, yeah,

**Helena E**  45:12  
yeah. The problem is, is with this one, that it's the World Health sterilization. So someone could come from Germany and ask us a question, but someone could come from Fiji and ask us a question, and it's going to be two very different prices.

**Karen Doane**  45:27  
Yeah, yeah. You don't have to get prices ballparks, fine,

**Helena E**  45:31  
yeah, but if we give them USD ballpark, they all usually can convert that in their

**Karen Doane**  45:37  
head, yeah, I do USD all the time. It's much easier, because everyone I know you, they understand it. That's what I mean. They don't know what you're doing with Australian and it's silly.

**Helena E**  45:49  
They don't know the conversion to Australia. No, they

**Karen Doane**  45:52  
know it to us. So that's fine, okay? So, but they would also want to see that if they sell your units,

**Speaker 2**  46:00  
their customer gets the spec sheets, and their customer has all the right things that, because they would be giving them out, they're not hiding that. They buy it from you. They're a supplier, so they want to see, yeah, oh, this is the specs for that. This is how it comes and their client's going to be happy because you, you make their them look good. Yeah, you want to make them look good.

**Karen Doane**  46:23  
Okay, so is that's really the whole purpose is getting them on board. Yes, rather than just one little hospital.

**Helena E**  46:33  
Man, exactly, we want, like, three

46:38  
interested distributors from this show. Yes, did you mark

**Karen Doane**  46:41  
up which ones you were targeting?

**Helena E**  46:45  
We know which ones, and we're hoping that there's a few from America also there. It'll be different teams of people, but at least we can pull that lever to say, Oh, we actually have had a few emails between your CEO and us about partnering.

**Karen Doane**  47:01  
You know, yeah, we're so much better when the trust is immediate when you talk. That's what. Yes, that is what's good. So as long as you're that's why. If we can tick the boxes like, Oh, they're capable, because they might love you, but if they're like, Oh, well, I can't know if they're going to supply the numbers. It doesn't matter how much they love you. We want to cover those bases so they can see we've got this,

**Helena E**  47:23  
and they would be super interested in standards and stuff, because they would never take on a product that doesn't make their standards, which we're looking into now. So we've just found that there's another standard which we think we are compliant for, over in Europe, in the UK, and it's a UN standard, but we're just struggling to find out if we even need that standard for our type of products.

**Karen Doane**  47:51  
Okay, cool. So when also this case study, then that I want you to also do as a second case study is how long it took? Oh, this is how, like a story of someone ordering it from overseas, yes, yeah, and how it was, can you see what I mean? And we just visually be able to put on the page, boom de boom, de boom, de boom. It was easy. Yeah, that's all we really need. That's what I really with those people. I think that they need to see that in your capability, that's a time like, you're not going to be promising anything, but it's like eight to 12 week turnaround promise. Do you know? Like, but we're working with your timelines. Do you know, look, you see what I mean, like, that's the sort of little visual that we could show them easily in it that will, will make them build that trust, because I think they are going to love you that there's something wrong at the moment, is the non trust of the capability, I'd say,

**Helena E**  48:59  
yes, there's also a few groups like Mercy Ships and stuff that we've donated, and it's not products, but toys and stuff too, which I think will build trust of people around the world.

49:11  
Okay, so

**Helena E**  49:15  
the hospitals that are on the boats that one of them was around at Madagascar at the moment.

**Karen Doane**  49:21  
So we we do, like I have collected all the stuff from your history, because I do think it does show value. You building it. You buying it off Hal quin they were the family business. You bought it and you've built it. Yes, you see what I mean in the timeline, the picture would be like that. I'm not going to panic again. That's a nice to have, because there's a lot of files. So I was just like, I'm not going to panic about that. But I think that the we do want to put on the website, and again, in this cape, when we're saying capability statement, it is almost. Most like a brochure capability statement where it's like, and also this is like, give back because that's about your care values. So that's how you're when we show your values, we're showing how you behave with those values.

**Helena E**  50:16  
We've also just changed our boys workshops, or the guys downstairs, sorry, work shirts to that trade much brand that do all the super colorful blue collar work shirts that go to men's mental health for our sustainability report. So I thought that's something we can add in there. Add

**Karen Doane**  50:37  
that in. So these are the little bits of information that I want you to give me that you'll be building. So now, if I spend the rest of this week because I'm I still know I'm still feeling, what day you leaving? I wanted to know that panicking. 27 Okay, good, good, good. Alright, so in my brain, we've got two more weeks, which is, right, yeah, I'm just aiming for two more weeks, because that's really otherwise, I'll spend way too much time anyway, but I still want to, I still will be making sure you get done, because we just Yeah, which is pumped for the 2/27 we're pumped so that you're all done. So I, if I when I'm going to need to go and do is just sort stuff out and start making things. Yes, you do your sorting and looking through those targets and stuff. So that will save me doing that stuff. And then next week we will, really, I'd imagine, have stuff that we can start refining as start. Yeah, I'd like to know who, if you mark on that list of distributors, who, so I can see who are the ones you're targeting. I want to see them. I want to see who they are so I know what they look like, because you've got a thing again. They want to feel comfortable that you feel the same as them, yes. So I just want to see them, to see that they're in like I have got the right picture in my brain for that. And then, yeah, I think you just need to, like the things I've said to you in terms of get those bits that I've said. And Elena, I think everything else you'll see, there's a lot of stuff really just in that folder for you to look through. Yeah?

**Speaker 2**  52:21  
So, yeah, I think that would keep you busy. Don't panic. You can cross stuff out, because it's all that AI stuff. I'm just like, you guys go through it as well. I've read it, but I'm like, you guys, that will make it much quicker. And then I'll start really putting that together on the design, so that at least we have, like, a template. I think I'm going to have to do the capability one for you, and yes, to really get it, because

**Helena E**  52:45  
that'll at least give the feel to identity.

**Karen Doane**  52:49  
Like, the brand guide thing, I don't care, sorry. Like, I don't care. She can put what she wants in that one she's done already. Like, that's an identity guide she can because I'll be giving her those files that I've done, and we'll paste them in. And I've said to her, we just got to practice like we've got to start playing with it so we know now how it looks. I wanted her to do a mock up of the web page,

**Speaker 2**  53:17  
but I think she might just be able to duplicate it and then just change it, we'll see, rather than mock it up, because it should be easy. The one you've got on the front end now is really the one we want to make it look nice. Yeah, we want to make that look a little bit tidier. But that, again, shouldn't be that hard. I don't think that's the end of the world to do, if you guys are on it with looking at the copy and just refining that, I'll just keep making sure that stuff's done. And then, yeah, really that it would be I also want to make sure that when we finish, you've got the bot, so it's not just like a once off exercise, because I still think there's a lot more optimizing to do?

**Karen Doane**  54:02  
Yeah, we go to the website, and you've really got to, like, continue the work. So I want to try and make sure you're set up as possible. And also, so you stay on brand,

**Helena E**  54:11  
you can check everything. Yeah,

**Karen Doane**  54:15  
check everything, and you'll know. Anyway, once you know how, when you really know the people in you know how it's meant to look it. It's easier.

**Helena E**  54:22  
Lisa, another outcome for the conference, what would be really handy is like a two weeks before and a two weeks after. Content plan, like, what do we want to put on our social media to talk to them the

**Isabelle Em**  54:37  
right way, exactly, especially upcoming, like in the two two weeks

**Helena E**  54:41  
before and two weeks after, two weeks after

**Karen Doane**  54:44  
get ready, we're like, we're going, yep, yep, like, yeah,

**Helena E**  54:50  
okay, to make sure that that's all on brand, because we don't want that to be in our old brand and old brand boys, yeah, and turn up all the new stuff that. And, oh, is this the same? Yeah.

**Karen Doane**  55:02  
I mean, I do think you're not, we're not shifting you. We're only doing a makeover. That's the thing. I don't think we need to shift you that, because you do have a good reputation. You do have a good brand, and I think it looks pretty tidy, like the logo's clean. I really think it's fine. It's just gone a little bit. Just need to keep the barriers on it, and we need to get some a bit more guidelines on like the rules on grids. Yes, but it should be fine. I feel, I feel fine. She's Odette knows what she's doing, I think, in design, or does, she does need that help. And when you know the reason why you're using the colors, that's like, even with the font. So I was like, yeah, it's not like, there's a set size for a h1 it's like, what do I want to say with that font? Why am I saying this sentence? Then I choose a font, not just like, because it's a rule. So that's where I was, like, we need to make sure that's all set up so we can check that off. I I'm excited because it is, it is going to be cool because you can do it on the bots. Because normally it's sad when other people go off brand. For me,

**Helena E**  56:11  
I'm looking forward to, are you going to have to train us how

**Karen Doane**  56:14  
to use the bots? Yeah, no, yeah, definitely, too. That is, oh, there isn't okay. I want to show you. I might, I'm, that's what the people in Papua, New Guinea I was like, I need to do. I have already written like, how to make one, like, especially if you're making the basic ones. I the only last thing I was going to check with you is that, can we make them in what's the one you're using, Odette, or what's No, what's the name of that? Your CMS thing, you're using ODU. I bet we can do them in ODU. That's why I was like, I've got my knowledge bases, and I'm making them clean and ready. But I believe, yeah, I think you'll be able to add them in there.

**Speaker 1**  56:58  
Well, make has it connects to ODU, has an open

**Speaker 2**  57:03  
API. I looked and there's a lot more. Yeah, there's loads. I think it's got it connects. I think, no, I think you cannot connect with chat GBT, like you've got chat BG in there. There's lots of things in there. I'm actually thinking with make, even though, like, It's fat, what I'm doing when I'm setting stuff up, I'm trying to think, What can I do that's not with make, with normal automation stuff, really, because a lot of things you could just automate normally. And then the there is some bits that you're like, No, forget it Google. I'm gonna have to use make to do that bit where I need AI to come in properly. But there's bits where it's just moving folders, I'm just pasting stuff in Google scripts, and it's doing it for me, and that's free. It's free. Otherwise, I'm paying every single time it's sending an email. And I'm like, I've got five companies, mate. I don't want to be paying every single time it's sending an email to the thing. So I'm looking I thought I'd look into I'll just ask about yours, but when I looked into it, I was like, that seems like that's going to have everything in there set up to help you, and you'd be able to plug these knowledge bases into it. Yes. So the most important thing is we get the knowledge bases is really just Excel documents, just so yeah, it's what one is with all the info. So then you can use it either like that, or you can up, we just upload it to, you know, and then use it with that. So that is the plan we are pushing. Then to get I'm still going to push for two weeks. I wasn't planning on doing much design work, but I still, I think I will need to do some but

**Speaker 1**  58:44  
capabilities, one, like, even if we can't get it printed, we can still have, like, a PDF copy, and we can email it to people straight away, like, that's

**Karen Doane**  58:52  
something they want to see. And I think between the two of us, it would be great if we could do the pitch deck.

59:01  
Yes, it would

**Karen Doane**  59:03  
be handy, because you could use it. So at the display, what have you got going around? Have you got somewhere where they you've got, like, a,

**Helena E**  59:09  
we've got a TV screen that hooks on to one of the wrap stations.

59:17  
So there is which the

**Helena E**  59:18  
medical staff actually put a computer screen on there to use it. So they're reading it as a

59:24  
display, but they actually use it as work, as work.

**Speaker 2**  59:28  
Okay, cool. So that would be good, like, really our messaging, whatever we're getting in messaging that we're putting in that capability, we'd sort of want to be slides that are just flicking around in the background as well. So I still think capability should be my main focus, because I like capability. So I think that's what's going to happen. It'll be like, once we get those points really clear, we can I think then I can say

**Karen Doane**  59:58  
I did try gamma. There is some good I'm not getting that. You would say I did like the profiles because I was hoping it would make all the slide decks for me. And it's pretty good, but it's nice. It's not that good. No, it's not that good. It's not that good that you can but at least the text is on the pages. Saves you copy and pasting. All right, my lovelies, well, I'm going to keep going with it you now have access and what I'll send you. I've got your personal email, so I will share that. If you do have any questions, let me know. I'm banging stuff in there. So it might also think, oh, this bit confusing, because normally I wouldn't science see, like, should be okay. In your folders, it's more the design folder, where you'll see there's more stuff going on, the creative but yeah, the marketing ones is like, that's under control. But there that was just in case, because I was like, otherwise, I'm moving them, and it's better that Odette can see and you guys can see, and we work together. Yeah, all right, we're in the two and a half stage, but I think we'll get there. I think we'll get there. We'll keep on it. Okay, perfect. Have a lovely tunnel. How good is it? Do you have rain today? So nice?

**Helena E**  1:01:10  
Yes, lots of rain.

**Karen Doane**  1:01:14  
So hot, though it was like 38 degrees or something on die. I'm so glad it's raining. I loved it. Yes, all the parts are green. Alright, my lovelies, you have the best day on purpose. I don't think it's Wednesday. I don't think we really need to meet again on Friday. I'm meeting, though a debt tomorrow, to go through the design, and I'll spend time with her, and then you guys can dig in, and then we will reconvene next Tuesday, because there is a lot to have a look and think about. You might even like if you want to talk to your dad or whatever you know like, because it's more like positioning and thinking, don't I've just Yeah, so you just have a think about that.
